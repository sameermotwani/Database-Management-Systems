<center><h1>Database Constraints</h1></center>
<p>

Although not null constraints, check constraints and assertions are part of the
SQL standard, no major database management system supports all of these
constraints.  The constraints that are seldom supported are assertions and
check constraints with subqueries.  Some databases, such as MySQL, will parse
constraints with no warnings, but will then ignore them.  As a result,
constraints must be enforced by some other technique.  One way to enforce
constraints is to use a programming language.  However, it is more reliable to
enforce constraints directly with the database because not all programs that
use the database will enforce the constraint. Indeed, the programmer might not
even know about the constraints.  Another way to enforce constraints is to use
triggers.  This technique is more reliable because it is enforced by the
database itself.  However, unlike SQL, the trigger syntax is not standard.  It
varies considerably from one database management system to another.  It is also
much more complicated to program the constraints.  This article explains two
strategies for enforcing constraints using triggers.  It uses the MySQL syntax
for triggers.  Oracle uses almost the same syntax.

<p>

The examples in this article use the following student course registration database:

<p>
<pre>
create table Student(
  id int primary key auto_increment,
  name varchar(255),
  major varchar(255)
);
create table Course(
  id int primary key auto_increment,
  code varchar(255) not null
);
create table Section(
  id int primary key auto_increment,
  number int not null,
  partOf int not null references Course(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table Registration(
  registers int references Student(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  registeredIn int references Section(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(registers, registeredIn)
);
</pre>
<p>

<h2>Enforcement with a Singular Table</h2>

A singular table is a table with exactly one row.  Here is an example of a singular table:

<p>
<pre>
create table Singular (
  id int primary key
);
insert into Singular(id) values (1);
</pre>
<p>

A singular table can be used for storing global attributes for the database.
It can also be used for enforcing constraints.  In order to use a singular
table for enforcing constraints, it is important that the singular table always
have a row with a fixed value for the id field.  In this case, it is being
assumed that the id field always has value 1.

<p>

<h3>Enforcing Not Null Constraints</h2>

<p>

We first consider how to enforce a not null constraint.  Most databases enforce
not null constraints so it is usually not necessary to enforce them with
triggers.  To enforce the constraint that the name column of the Student table
is not null, one can use the following trigger:

<p>
<pre>
create trigger NameNotNullInsert before insert on Student
for each row 
  insert into Singular(id) 
  select *
    from Singular si
   where new.name is null;
</pre>
<p>

This trigger is invoked whenever a new record is created for the Student table.
The trigger fires before the new record is inserted into the table.  The new
record is called "new".  The name for the new record being inserted varies from
one database system to another.  An illegal insert into the Singular table is
attempted for every record in the Singular table if the not null constraint for
name is violated for the new record being inserted into the Student table.
Since the Singular table has exactly one record, the insert into the Singular
table will be attempted at most once.  One could use either <code>select *</code>
or <code>select 1</code> for the select query on Singular.

<p>

Since the not null constraint could also be violated as a result of an update,
it is also necessary to create a trigger for update.

<p>
<pre>
create trigger NameNotNullUpdate before update on Student
for each row 
  insert into Singular(id) 
  select *
    from Singular si
   where new.name is null;
</pre>
<p>

<!-- These are test cases that are not shown on the HTML page. The ones that are commented will fail if executed.
<pre>
insert into Student(name, major) values('Angel Bose', 'CS');
-- insert into Student(name, major) values(null, 'CS');
-- update Student set name=null;
select * from Student;
</pre>
-->

<p>

<h3>Check Constraints without Subqueries</h2>

<p>

A check constraint is specified as a clause within a table definition.  For
example, suppose that we wanted to specify that the number of a section must be
positive.  The table definition for Section would look like this:

<p>
 <pre>
create table Section(
  id int primary key auto_increment,
  number int not null,
  constraint SectionNumberPositive check (number &gt; 0),
  partOf int not null references Course(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
</pre>
<p>

Most major database management systems support check constraints that do not
have subqueries.  However, some do not support even these check constraints, so
triggers are useful for such databases.  To enforce the check constraint using
triggers, one must create the following two triggers:

<p>
<pre>
create trigger NumberPositiveInsert before insert on Section
for each row 
  insert into Singular(id) 
  select *
    from Singular si
   where new.number <= 0;

create trigger NumberPositiveUpdate before update on Section
for each row 
  insert into Singular(id) 
  select *
    from Singular si
   where new.number <= 0;
</pre>
<p>

In general, all that is necessary is to negate the check constraint.  The rest
of the trigger definition is the same for any check constraint.

<!-- These are test cases that are not shown on the HTML page. The ones that are commented will fail if executed.
<pre>
insert into Course(code) values('CS1000');
insert into Section(number, partOf) select 1, c.id from Course c where c.code = 'CS1000';
insert into Section(number, partOf) select 2, c.id from Course c where c.code = 'CS1000';
-- insert into Section(number, partOf) select 0, c.id from Course c where c.code = 'CS1000';
select * from Section;
</pre>
-->

<p>

<h3>Assertions</h2>

<p>

An assertion is a condition that the database must always satisfy.  The syntax
is the following:

<p>
 <pre>
create assertion &lt;assertion name> check &lt;condition>
</pre>
<p>

For example, to assert that a student may not be enrolled in two sections of
the same course one can use this assertion:

<p>
 <pre>
create assertion NoRedundantSectionEnrollment
  check not exists (
          select *
            from Student s, Registration r, Section se, Course c
           where s.id = r.registers
             and se.id = r.registeredIn
             and c.id = se.partOf
           group by s.id, c.id
          having count(*) > 1
        );
</pre>
<p>

In other words, when one joins the Student, Registration, Section and Course
tables, and then groups by student and course, one should never have more than
1 record in each group.

<p>

The first step for converting the assertion to triggers is to examine
the from clause to determine which of the tables in the from clause are being
constrained by this assertion. These are the tables such that a violation of
the assertion will occur when one creates a new record in one of these tables.
In this case, there is just one table that is being constrained: the
Registration table. The assertion is that a student cannot have two different
registrations that are for the same course.

<p>

The last step is to write the triggers. There will be three triggers in
general, one for insert, one for update and one for delete.  Here is the
trigger for insert:

<p>
<pre>
create trigger NoRedundantSectionEnrollmentInsert after insert on Registration
for each row 
  insert into Singular(id)
  select *
    from Singular si
   where exists (
          select *
            from Student s, Registration r, Section se, Course c
           where s.id = r.registers
             and se.id = r.registeredIn
             and c.id = se.partOf
           group by s.id, c.id
          having count(*) > 1
        );
</pre>
<p>

In general, the triggers for update and delete look the same, but replace
"insert" with "update" and "delete", respectively, In this case, the constraint
cannot be violated by a delete, so one can omit this trigger.

<p>

Note that "not exists" in the assertion becomes "exists" in the trigger. In
general, the condition of the assertion must be negated when used in a
trigger.  That is because the trigger is fired when a violation of the assertion
is being attempted.  This trigger will attempt to insert an illegal record into
the Singular table whenever one has inserted a Registration record that would
violate the assertion condition.  The record being inserted into the Singular
table is illegal because it has the same id value as the record already in the
table.  As a result, the attempt to insert the Registration record will fail if
the assertion condition does not hold.

<p>

This trigger will attempt to insert an illegal record in the Singular
table for every record already in the Singular table.  This is why it is
necessary for the Singular table to have at least one record.  In addition, it is
helpful to have just one record in the Singular table so that the test does as
little work as possible.  However, the trigger will still function correctly
even if the Singular table has more than one record.

<p>

In the assertion, nothing about the student and course records is used other
than their id fields.  So the assertion could have been simplified to the
following:

<p>
 <pre>
create assertion NoRedundantSectionEnrollment
  check not exists (
          select *
            from Registration r, Section se
           where se.id = r.registeredIn
           group by r.registers, se.partOf
          having count(*) > 1
        );
</pre>
<p>

The trigger would then also be simplified.

<p>
<!-- These are test cases that are not shown on the HTML page. The ones that are commented will fail if executed.
<pre>
insert into Registration(registers, registeredIn) select s.id, se.id from Student s, Section se where s.name = 'Angel Bose' and se.number = 1;
-- insert into Registration(registers, registeredIn) select s.id, se.id from Student s, Section se where s.name = 'Angel Bose' and se.number = 2;
</pre>
-->

<p>

<h3>Check Constraints with Subqueries</h2>

<p>

The last possibility we consider is the case of a check constraint with a
subquery.  Such a constraint is as powerful as an assertion.  Any assertion can
be expressed as a check constraint and vice versa.  For example the
NoRedundantSectionEnrollment assertion could be expressed as a check constraint
of the Student table as follows:

<p>
 <pre>
create table Student(
  id int primary key auto_increment,
  name varchar(255),
  major varchar(255),
  constraint NoRedundantSectionEnrollment check (
        not exists (
          select *
            from Registration r, Section se, Course c
           where id = r.registers
             and se.id = r.registeredIn
             and c.id = se.partOf
           group by c.id
          having count(*) > 1
        )
);
</pre>
<p>

Note that it is not necessary to include the Student id field in the group by
because there is only one student record being checked.  To enforce a check
constraint with a subquery, one should first rewrite it as an assertion, and
then use the procedure already explained above.  The reason for doing it this
way is that the table in which the check constraint occurs is not necessarily
one of the relevant tables for defining triggers.  Indeed, for the
NoRedundantSectionEnrollment, the check constraint is in the Student table, but
the relevant table is the Registration table.

<p>

<h2>Enforcement with an Error Table</h2>

<p>

This strategy does not prevent violations of integrity. It simply documents
them. The database administrator is then responsible for fixing the violations.
Instead of creating a singular table, one creates a table where one can write
error messages.

<p>
<pre>
create table Error (
  message varchar(1023),
  primary key(message(300))
);
</pre>
<p>

By allowing messages with up to 1023 bytes, the maximum size of a message is
too large for inclusion in a primary key. Writing message(300) in the primary
key means that only the first 300 bytes of the message will be used in the
primary index. The messages may be longer than 300 bytes but must be unique in
the first 300 bytes.  This table is a not object-oriented. It represents a set
of error message strings, not a set of error message objects.

<p>

One of the triggers for ensuring that students are not registered in two
sections of the same course using this strategy looks like this:

<p>
<pre>
drop trigger NoRedundantSectionEnrollmentInsert;
create trigger WarnRedundantSectionEnrollmentInsert after insert on Registration
for each row 
  insert into Error(message)
  select concat('A student ', s.name, ' has registered in two sections of ', c.code)
    from Student s, Course c
   where exists (
           select *
             from Section se, Registration r
            where s.id = r.registers
              and se.id = r.registeredIn
              and c.id = se.partOf
            having count(*) > 1
         );
</pre>
<p>

There should also be a trigger for update.  For many databases, one can only
have one trigger for each of the six events for a table. So the trigger that
was previously created must be dropped.  The <code>concat</code> function is
the string concatenation functions.  It corresponds to the <code>+</code>
operator in Java when it is applied to strings.

<p>

These triggers will write a message into the Error table for every instance of
a student and course for which the student is registered in multiple sections
of this course. Note that this includes students and courses other than the
student and course being registered by the insert statement that triggered the
action.  If such a message has already been written to the Error table, then
the insert will fail.  So the first violation will be permitted but recorded in
the Error table, while subsequent ones will be forbidden until the the message
is deleted from the Error table.

<p>

The advantage of the error message strategy is that the administrator has
better information about what caused the failure.  The first (singular table)
strategy will cause the command to fail but does not explain why the failure
occurred.  Combining them would give both of the advantages.  However, remember
that there can only be one trigger for each kind of event.  So combining
trigger actions requires that one use the stored procedure language of the
database.

<p>

<!-- These are test cases that are not shown on the HTML page. The one that is commented will fail if executed.
<pre>
insert into Registration(registers, registeredIn) select s.id, se.id from Student s, Section se where s.name = 'Angel Bose' and se.number = 2;
select * from Error;
-- insert into Registration(registers, registeredIn) select s.id, se.id from Student s, Section se where s.name = 'Angel Bose' and se.number = 2;
</pre>
-->

<p>

<h2>Enforcement using the Stored Procedure Language</h2>

<p>

The two strategies discussed so far used only the trigger syntax and SQL
commands.  If one is willing to use the stored procedure language of the
database, then there are other possibilities, such as the following:

<ul>
<li>If the stored procedure language has a way to define exceptions and to
throw them, then this is one of the best strategies.  For the
NoRedundantSectionEnrollment assertion, it looks something like this:

<p>
 <pre>
create trigger WarnRedundantSectionEnrollmentInsert after insert on Registration
for each row
  declare RedundantSectionEnrollment exception;
  begin
    if (exists (
          select *
            from Section se, Registration r
           where s.id = r.registers
             and se.id = r.registeredIn
             and c.id = se.partOf
           having count(*) > 1
        )
    then raise RedundantSectionEnrollment;
    end if;
  end;
</pre>
<p>

The actual syntax will depend on the particular stored procedure language, of
couse.  If an exception is raised and not caught, then the transaction in which
the command is being executed will be rolled back.

<li>Another strategy is to explicitly roll back the transaction.  This is less
powerful than raising an exception because there is no way to "catch" such a
rollback command.  However, some databases do not support user-defined
exceptions.  For the NoRedundantSectionEnrollment assertion, it looks something
like this:

<p>
 <pre>
drop trigger WarnRedundantSectionEnrollmentInsert;
create trigger WarnRedundantSectionEnrollmentInsert after insert on Registration
for each row
  begin
    if (exists (
          select *
            from Section se, Registration r
           where s.id = r.registers
             and se.id = r.registeredIn
             and c.id = se.partOf
           having count(*) > 1
        )
    then rollback;
    end if;
  end;
</pre>
<p>

The actual syntax will depend on the particular stored procedure language, of
couse.

</ul>

<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>

Obviously, all of these strategies are a very clumsy way to enforce integrity
constraints.  Directly specifying not null, check and assertion constraints is
far easier.  Unfortunately, no major database management system all of these
kinds of constraints.  At best, they support not null constraints and check
constraints that do not have subqueries.  Some don't even support these (such
as MySQL) in all cases.  So currently the only reliable way to enforce these
constraints, in general, is to use triggers.
