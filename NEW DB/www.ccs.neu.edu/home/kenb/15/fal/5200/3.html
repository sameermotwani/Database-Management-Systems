<center><h1>CS 5200 Introduction to Database Management Assignment #3</h1></center>
<p>

<ol>

<li>The first part of this assignment uses the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.1/CMIS-v1.1.html">CMIS</a> data model:

<center><img src="Object.jpg"></center>
<center><img src="Details.jpg"></center>
<center><img src="Meta.jpg"></center>

<p>

Assume that the UML class diagram is represented in the relational model using the JOINED strategy for inheritance
and fixed enumerations.

<p>

<ol type="a">

<li>Develop an assertion, written in SQL, that enforces the requirement that
every CMIS relationship object has a source object that has a type that is
allowed by the relationship object type of the relationship object.

<li>Give the user 'kong.f@husky.neu.edu' read-only access to all queryable documents
whose query name begins with "kong".

</ol>

<p>

<li>The second part of this assignment uses the following data model:

<p>
<center><img src="products3.jpg"></center>
<p>
This is the relational database schema that must be used:
<p>
<pre>
create table ProductType (
  id int primary key,
  title varchar(200),
  description varchar(2000) not null,
  size int not null
);
create table Product (
  id int primary key,
  started date not null,
  completed date,
  label varchar(200),
  type int not null,
  foreign key(type) references ProductType(id) on update cascade on delete no action,
  processedBy int unique,
  foreign key(processedBy) references Machine(id) on update cascade on delete set null
);
create table Factory (
  id int primary key,
  address varchar(200) not null unique
);
create table Machine (
  id int primary key,
  code varchar(200) not null,
  partOf int,
  foreign key(partOf) references Factory(id) on update cascade on delete no action,
  unique(code, partOf)
);
create table Employee (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(200) not null unique
);
create table Qualification (
  canRepair int,
  foreign key(canRepair) references ProductType(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  canBeRepairedBy int,
  foreign key(canBeRepairedBy) references Employee(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(canRepair, canBeRepairedBy),
  level enum('Novice', 'Intermediate', 'Expert') -- Enumeration strategy: fixed enumeration
);
</pre>
<p>

The following are the main commands being performed on this database:

<p>

<ol type="a">

<li>Given an employee specified by name, find the machines that the employee can repair.

<li>Find a product type given the first part of its title.

<li>List all products, showing all of its attributes as well as the code of its machine,
that have yet to be completed.

<li>Modify the qualification level of an employee, given by name, for a product type given by title.

<li>Find a factory given its address.

</ol>

<p>

Design the indexes for the database.

</ol>
