<center><h1>CS 5200 Introduction to Database Management Individual Assignment #4</h1></center>
<p>
This assignment uses the following data model:
<p>
<center><img src="products3.jpg"></center>
<p>
This is the relational database schema that must be used:
<p>
<pre>
create table ProductType (
  id int primary key,
  title varchar(200),
  description varchar(2000) not null,
  size int not null
);
create table Product (
  id int primary key,
  started date not null,
  completed date,
  label varchar(200),
  type int not null,
  foreign key(type) references ProductType(id) on update cascade on delete no action
);
create table Factory (
  id int primary key,
  address varchar(200) not null unique
);
create table Machine (
  id int primary key,
  code varchar(200) not null,
  partOf int,
  foreign key(partOf) references Factory(id) on update cascade on delete no action,
  unique(code, partOf)
);
create table Employee (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(200) not null
);
create table Qualification (
  canRepair int,
  foreign key(canRepair) references ProductType(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  canBeRepairedBy int,
  foreign key(canBeRepairedBy) references Employee(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(canRepair, canBeRepairedBy),
  level enum('Novice', 'Intermediate', 'Expert') -- Enumeration strategy: fixed enumeration
);
create table ProductProcessor ( -- Implementation of the Product-Machine association
  processes int primary key,
  foreign key(processes) references Product(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  processedBy int not null unique,
  foreign key(processedBy) references Machine(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li>

Develop a Java program using JDBC that assigns employees to repair broken
machines.  The input is a list of pairs, each of which specifies a factory
address and machine code.  The output is a map from employees to machines.  No
employee can be assigned to more than one machine.  Assign as many expert
employees as possible first, then assign as many intermediate employees as
possible to the remaining machines and finally as many novice employees as
possible to any machines that are still remaining.

<p>

<li>

Develop Java Bean classes for the classes in the diagram above, and
annotate the classes using JPA.

<p>

<li>

Using JPQL, write a query that will find all employees that are qualified to
repair a specified machine.  The query depends on three parameters: the
qualification level, the factory address and the machine code.

</ol>

<p>


Submit your assignment using a zip file containing your Java file(s).
