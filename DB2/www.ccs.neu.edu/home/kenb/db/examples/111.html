<center><h1>Solution to Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="112.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>
<ol>
<li>What are the two basic approaches to organize index data structures?
<p>
Tree structures and hash tables. (3 points each)
<li>What is a rid?  Explain both what it is and what it is used for.
<p>
A rid is a record identifier (3 points). 
It uniquely identifies a record in a table (3 points).
Another way to say this is that it allows one to find a record on disk.
<li>What are the three alternatives for what to store as a data entry in an index?
<p>
One can store (1) an entire record (3 points), (2) a search key value (3 points) 
and a rid, or (3) a search key value and a rid list (3 points).
<li>Explain what a hash function does.
<p>
It converts data to a number (3 points) in a specified range of numbers (3 points).
Instead of "specified range" one could speak about a disk location or position in
an array.
<li>What is the fan-out of a tree?
<p>
The average number of child nodes (3 points) 
of the root node or an internal node 
(i.e., a non-leaf node) of the tree (3 points).
<li>What is data striping?
<p>
It is a technique for storing data in equal-sized units (3 points)
distributed over multiple disks (3 points).  One could say "bit or block"
instead of "equal-sized unit".
<li>Normally a parity bit will detect an error but it cannot correct it.
Why is it possible for a parity bit to correct an error in a RAID array?
<p>
When a disk error occurs, the hardware reports which disk drive had the fault (3 points).
Since one knows which bits are erroneous, parity is sufficient for correcting the 
error (3 points).
<li>Give two ways to organize a record with variable-length fields.
<p>
One can use either a delimiter character (3 points), 
or one can use an array of offsets at the start
of the record (3 points).  
Yet another way is to specify the length of each variable-length field
at the start of the field.
<li>Why does clustering have performance advantages for data stored on a disk?
<p>
It has an advantage because data is read or written using whole blocks (3 points).  
If related information is on the same block (3 points), 
then related data will be retrieved or updated at the same time at
no extra cost (3 points).
