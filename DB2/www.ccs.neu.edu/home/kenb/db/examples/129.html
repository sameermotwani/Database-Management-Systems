<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
This assignment will use the following SQL schema:
<p>
<pre>
create table Person(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null
);
create table Style(
  id int primary key,
  description varchar(20000)
);
create table Band(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255),
  style int,
  foreign key(style) references Style(id) on update cascade on delete set null
);
create table memberOf(
  person int,
  foreign key(person) references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  band int,
  foreign key(band) references Band(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(person, band)
);
create table StyleName(
  style int,
  foreign key(style) references Style(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  name varchar(200),
  primary key(name, style)
);
</pre>
<p>
Design and develop persistable classes for Person, Band and Style with
JPA annotations that map to the schema above. Note that the memberOf
and StyleName tables do not have corresponding classes.  Develop a
main program that performs the following tasks using the JPA query
language, printing the results of queries. Test your program using
OpenJPA. The queries must use the JPA object-oriented query language,
not SQL.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Show all bands that a musician is a member of, along with the
names of the styles of the bands. The input is the musician id. Show
the musician name, band name, and list the style names all on a single
line.
<li>Compute the number of degrees of separation between a specified
musician (specified by id) and any other musician, using only bands
having a style with a specified name. Show the degree of separation
and the other musician's name in ascending order by degree of
separation and other musician name.
</ol>
