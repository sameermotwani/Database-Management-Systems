<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
This part of the assignment uses the rationale database in <a href="3.html3.html">Assignment #3</a>.
<p>
Express the following queries in SQL:
<ol>
 <li>Find the solutions that are very supported by every related criterion.
     For each such solution show the issue subject.
 <li>Find all issue subjects (without duplicates) with no solutions that were unfavorably reviewed by George.
 <li>Find the criteria that have never been neutral toward a solution that Fred has favored.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
This part of the assignment uses a database of books.
A book is divided into chapters which are divided into sections.
Each part of a book (i.e., the whole book, a chapter or a section) has a title.
A book may have an author, a chapter may have a quotation, and a section has text.
A section may cite parts of the same or other books. Here is the schema:
<p>
<pre>
create table Part(
  id int primary key,
  title varchar(255) not null
);
create table Book(
  id int primary key,
  foreign key(id) references Part(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  author varchar(255)
);
create table Chapter(
  id int primary key,
  foreign key(id) references Part(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  book int not null,
  foreign key(book) references Book(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  quotation varchar(2000)
);
create table Section(
  id int primary key,
  foreign key(id) references Part(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  chapter int not null,
  foreign key(chapter) references Chapter(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  text varchar(60000) not null
);
create table SectionCitation(
  section int,
  foreign key(section) references Section(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  citation int,
  foreign key(citation) references Part(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(section, citation)
);
</pre>
<p>
Express the following queries using the relational algebra:
<ol>
<li>Citations to George's books.
<pre>
select p.id, p.title
  from Book b, Chapter c, Section s, SectionCitation sc, Part p
 where b.author = 'George'
   and c.id = s.chapter
   and s.id = sc.section
   and p.id = sc.citation
   and b.id = c.book;
</pre>
<li>Chapters of "War and Peace" that are not cited.
<pre>
select c.id
  from Book b, Chapter c, Part p
 where c.book = b.id
   and p.title = 'War and Peace'
   and p.id = c.id
   and not exists(
        select *
          from SectionCitation sc
         where sc.citation = c.id
   );
</pre>
<li>Authors that have a part title beginning with "And ".
<pre>
select b.author
  from Part p, Section s, Chapter c, Book b
 where p.title like 'And %'
   and p.id = s.id
   and s.chapter = c.id
   and c.book = b.id
union
select b.author
  from Part p, Chapter c, Book b
 where p.title like 'And %'
   and p.id = c.id
   and c.book = b.id
union
select b.author
  from Part p, Book b
 where p.title like 'And %'
   and p.id = b.id;
</pre>
</ol>
