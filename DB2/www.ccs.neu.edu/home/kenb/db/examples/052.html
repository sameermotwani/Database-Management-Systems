<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
This assignment uses the rationale database of <a href="3.html3.html">Assignment #3</a>.
For the first 3 parts of this assignment, design an SQL query to extract
the specified information from the rationale database.
<p>
<ol>
<li>For each issue, show the number of solutions, the number of related
    criteria and the number of arguments.
<li>For each issue and alternative solution, compute how support the
    the criteria are to the solution. Convert support levels to numbers
    by using +2 for 'very supportive', +1 for 'supportive', 0 for 'neutral',
    -1 for 'opposed to' and -2 for 'strongly opposed to'. The sum of the
    support levels measures how supportive the criteria are to the alternative.
<li>For each person (author name) show how many arguments posted by that person
    were favorable to an alternative and how many were unfavorable.
<li>
<p>
Design and test a class with the following methods:
 <ol>
 <li>A method that lists the subjects of the solutions that were
     posted by a person. The method has one parameter that specifies
     the person name. The method returns a list of strings.
 <li>A method that lists the arguments that are in favor of a
     specified issue subject. The method has one parameter that
     specifies the issue subject and returns a list of objects that
     have two instance variables: the description and the author.
 <li>A method that lists the distinct names of all persons (author names) 
     who posted a criterion related to a specified issue with a specified
     support level. The method
     has two parameters: the support level and the subject of the issue.
 </ol>
The constructor of your class must load your driver and connect to
your database. The constructor should have the following parameters:
 <ol>
 <li>The fully qualified name of the driver class.
 <li>The URL for the database server.
 <li>The username.
 <li>The password.
 </ol>
Write a main program in your class that tests the methods of
the class using your own database server.
</ol>
