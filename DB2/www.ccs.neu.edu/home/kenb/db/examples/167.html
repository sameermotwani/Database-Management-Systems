<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="168.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>
<ol>
<pre>
create table Person(
  id int primary key,
  dob date not null,
  name varchar(255) not null
);
create table Band(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null unique,
  style varchar(255)
);
create table Instrument(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  musicalKey varchar(255)
);
create table plays(
  musician int references Person(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  instrument int references Instrument(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  primary key(musician, instrument)
);
create table memberOf(
  person int references Person(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  band int references Band(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  primary key(person, band)
);
create table StringInstrument(
  id int primary key references Instrument(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  numberOfStrings int not null
);
create table BrassInstrument(
  id int primary key references Instrument(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  numberOfValves int not null
);
create table PercussionInstrument(
  id int primary key references Instrument(id) on delete cascade on update cascade
);
</pre>
<li>Design SQL queries for the following tasks:
 <ol>
 <li>Find all bands that have style "indie pop" or that have no style at all.
<pre>
select b.id
  from Band b
 where b.style is null
    or b.style = 'indie pop';
</pre>
 <li>Find all distinct percussionists and their names in ascending order by age.
<pre>
select distinct m.id, m.name
  from Person m, plays p, Instrument i, PercussionInstrument pi
 where p.musician = m.id
   and p.instrument = i.id
   and i.id = pi.id
 order by m.dob desc;
</pre>
which can be simplified to:
<pre>
select distinct m.id, m.name
  from Person m, plays p, PercussionInstrument pi
 where p.musician = m.id
   and p.instrument = pi.id
 order by m.dob desc;
</pre>
 <li>For each indie pop band, show its name and the number of musicians in the band.
     Include only the bands that have at least 4 members.
<pre>
select b.name, count(p.id) c
  from Band b, memberOf m, Person p
 where m.person = p.id
   and m.band = b.id
   and b.style = 'indie pop'
 group by b.id
having c >= 4;
</pre>
which can be simplified to:
<pre>
select b.name, count(m.person) c
  from Band b, memberOf m
 where m.band = b.id
   and b.style = 'indie pop'
 group by b.id
having c >= 4;
</pre>
or simplifying even more:
<pre>
select b.name, count(*) c
  from Band b, memberOf m
 where m.band = b.id
   and b.style = 'indie pop'
 group by b.id
having c >= 4;
</pre>
 </ol>
