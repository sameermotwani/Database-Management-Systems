<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
This example will use the following SQL schema:
<p>
<pre>
create table Forest(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(500),
  area double not null,
  location varchar(500) not null
);
create table TreeSpecies(
  scientificName varchar(255) primary key,
  description varchar(5000)
);
create table ForestTree(
  forest int,
  foreign key(forest) references Forest(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  tree varchar(255),
  foreign key(tree) references TreeSpecies(scientificName) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  status enum('extinct', 'threatened', 'least concern') not null,
  primary key(forest, tree)
);
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Develop queries (or sets of queries) for the following:
<ol type="a">
<li>List all extinct tree species and their forests.  A tree species 
is <em>extinct</em> if every forest in which it occurs, the status is extinct,
or if the tree species is not associated with any forest.
<li>List all threatened tree species and the total area of all forests
that have the tree species and it is not extinct in that forest.  Order
them by the total area.
A tree species is <em>threatened</em> if it is either threatened or extinct
in every forest where it is one of the tree species in the forest.
</ol>
<p>
The queries are in <a href="src/Trees.java">Trees.java</a>.
<p>
<li>Develop two XSLT scripts that produce HTML files for the output of
each of the two queries (or sets of queries) above as produced by javax.sql.rowset.WebRowSet.writeXml(ResultSet rs, OutputStream oStream).
The HTML file should display the results
as a table with a column for the scientific name and row(s) for the other
information.
<ol type="a">
<li>  
There should be one row for each forest,
with columns for the name and location.  Note that there could be tree
species with no forests.  
A separate table shows the descriptions of the tree species
in the first table.
For example:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Tree<th>Forest<th>Location
<tr><td rowspan="2">G. biloba<td>Tian Mu Shan<td>Zhejiang
<tr><td>Tianmu<td>Zhejiang
<tr><td rowspan="1">B. archaeocarpa<td>Kennedy Range<td>Australia
<tr><td rowspan="1">P. peregrinus
</table>
<p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Tree<th>Description
<tr><td>G. biloba<td>Ancient non-flowering tree
<tr><td>B. archaeocarpa<td>Small tree with bright flower spikes
<tr><td rowspan="1">P. peregrinus<td>Pine tree
</table>
<p>
The transform is in <a href="src/query1.xsl">query1.xsl</a>.
<p>
<li>
For the second query, show the tree scientific name and the area.
For example:
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Tree<th>Area
<tr><td>A. ulugurensis<td>4000
<tr><td>A. digitata<td>6000
<tr><td>A. quanzensis<td>8000
</table>
<p>
The transform is in <a href="src/query2.xsl">query2.xsl</a>.
<p>
</ol>
</ol>
