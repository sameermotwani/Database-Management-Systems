<center><h3>Sample Problems and Solutions</h3></center>
<p>
Some of the examples use the following Shoe Store database:
<pre>
create table Store(
  id int primary key,
  location varchar(200) not null
);
create table ShoeType(
  id int primary key,
  style varchar(100) not null,
  size varchar(10) not null,
  color varchar(50)
);
create table ShoeInventory(
  type int references ShoeType(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  store int references Store(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  quantity int not null,
  check (quantity>=0),
  primary key(store, type)
);
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Storage and Indexing</b>. (10 points)
Assume the following sizes, counts and times for the Shoe Store database system:
<ol>
<li>A record requires an average of 6 bytes administrative overhead,
including the space required for specifying the rid.
<li>An int uses 4 bytes.
<li>A double uses 8 bytes.
<li>A color name uses an average of 10 bytes.
<li>A style uses an average of 40 bytes.
<li>A size uses an average of 4 bytes.
<li>A location uses an average of 40 bytes.
<li>There are 100 stores.
<li>There are 2K shoe types.
<li>The disk block size is 8K = 8192 bytes.
<li>A random disk access requires 5ms.
<li>A page can be transferred (read or write) in 0.2 ms = 200 microseconds.
</ol>
<p>
Every store has a record for every possible shoe type even if the
quantity in the inventory is 0.
Compute the approximate time required for the following query:
  Find all stores that have shoe type 738. The SQL for this query is:
<pre>
    select i.store
      from ShoeInventory i
     where i.type = 738
       and i.quantity > 0;
</pre>
<p>
<font color="green">
The size of a ShoeInventory record is 18 bytes on the average: 6 for the overhead
and 4 each for the 3 integers. One can fit 8192/18 &asymp; 450 records per block, but this
is a primary B-tree so there will only be around 300 records per block.
<p>
There are 2K shoe types and 100 stores, so there will be 200K ShoeInventory records.
This requires 200K/300 &asymp; 667 blocks.
<p>
The primary B-tree index is not usable in this case because the type is the second column
in the index. So the entire table must be scanned. It requires 2 random I/Os to read
the first record or 10ms. It then requires 666*0.2ms &asymp; 133ms to read the rest, for a
total of about 140ms in all.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring:
<ol>
<li>(2 points) Record size computation.
<li>Fully packed number of records is 450.
<li>If 2/3 full, the number of records is 300.
<li>There are 200K ShoeInventory records.
<li>The number of blocks required is about 667.
<li>(2 points) The table is scanned sequentially.
<li>The first record requires 10ms.
<li>(2 points) The other records require about 130ms.
<li>The total time is about 140ms.
</ol>
</font>
<p>

<li><b>Query Evaluation</b>. (12 points)
 <pre>
create table Store(
  id int primary key, -- [hash index]
  location varchar(200) not null -- [tree index]
);
create table ShoeType(
  id int primary key, -- [hash index]
  style varchar(100) not null, -- [tree index, 200 values]
  size varchar(10) not null, -- [tree index, 40 values]
  color varchar(50) -- [no index, 50 values]
);
create table ShoeInventory(
  type int references ShoeType(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  store int references Store(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  quantity int not null, -- [no index, varies from 0 to 1000]
  check (quantity>=0),
  primary key(store, type) -- [tree index]
);
</pre>
<p>
Show the optimized query evaluation plan for the following query:
<pre>
select s.location
  from ShoeInventory i, Store s, ShoeType t
 where i.store = s.id
   and i.type = t.id
   and t.style = 'Oxford'
   and i.quantity >= 100
   and t.size = '10';
</pre>
Show the evaluation plan as a tree with each internal node annotated
with the implementation technique. Explain why this is the optimal plan.
Do not show the approximate number of records that flow along each edge.
<p>
<font color="red">
The most common error was to omit the explanation. The exam clearly states
"Explain why this is the optimal plan." Points were deducted if there was
no explanation.
</font>
<p>
<font color="green">
There are two reasonable join orders: (Store, ShoeInventory, ShoeType)
and (ShoeType, ShoeInventory, Store). 
The Store table is the smallest, but after selecting on the style and size,
the number of ShoeType records will be even smaller. This suggests that
the join order should begin with ShoeType. On the other hand, this order
precludes the possibility of using an indexed nested loop join on the
ShoeInventory table because the primary key index has type as the second
column. However, starting with Store would result in an unselective
indexed nested loop join, so this possibility is not optimal.
<p>
There are two selections
on ShoeType: style and size. The style is more selective, so that is done first.
There is an index, but the table is so small (fitting in a single block) that
a scan would be faster. The selection on
the size must be scanned because there is no index on selected records.
<p>
As noted above, there is no suitable index on ShoeInventory, so a merge join
will be necessary. Accordingly, the selection on quantity should be performed
prior to the join to improve the performance of the merge join.
<p>
For the remaining join, the Store table is very small. In fact, it would fit
into a single block. So a merge join is best.
<p>
Finally, the projection to location is a scan because eliminating duplicates
is not required.

Points were allocated approximately equally to the join order,
other operator locations, implementation technique annotations,
and explanation for optimality. More precisely, the scoring was as follows:
<ol>
<li>(3 points) Join order.
<li>(3 points) Explanation that this is the optimal plan.
<li>(0.5 points) Select style (scan or index): correct location in evaluation plan
<li>(0.5 points) Select style (scan or index): annotated with acceptable implementation technique
<li>(0.5 points) Select size (scan technique): correct location in evaluation plan
<li>(0.5 points) Select size (scan technique): annotated with acceptable implementation technique
<li>(0.5 points) Select quantity (after join using scan): correct location in evaluation plan
<li>(0.5 points) Select quantity (after join using scan): annotated with acceptable implementation technique
<li>(0.5 points) Join ShoeType with ShoeInventory (indexed nested loop): correct location in evaluation plan
<li>(0.5 points) Join ShoeType with ShoeInventory (indexed nested loop): annotated with acceptable implementation technique
<li>(0.5 points) Join with Store (merge join): correct location in evaluation plan
<li>(0.5 points) Join with Store (merge join): annotated with acceptable implementation technique
<li>(0.5 points) Project location (scan): correct location in evaluation plan
<li>(0.5 points) Project location (scan): annotated with acceptable implementation technique

<li><b>Normalization</b>. (10 points)
Find the 3NF decomposition of the relation ABCDEFG such that the
following FDs hold:
<ul>                       
<li>AG&rarr;EC
<li>EG&rarr;B
<li>D&rarr;F
<li>B&rarr;C
</ul>
<p>
<font color="green">
<ol>
<li>Split the first FD into two FDs: AG&rarr;E and AG&rarr;C.
<li>Mininize the set of FDs. This is required by the 3NF algorithm. Two of the FDs have the
same right-hand side, so this is the only possiblity for a redundancy. Since B does not occur
on the left-hand side of any FD, it cannot be redundant. Since AG does occur on the left-hand
side of an FD this could be redundant. In fact, AG determines E, then EG determines B, and B determines C.
So AG&arr;C is a consequence of the other FDs. The minimum set of FDs is therefore:
<ul>                       
<li>AG&rarr;E
<li>EG&rarr;B
<li>D&rarr;F
<li>B&rarr;C
</ul>
<li>Find the candidate keys. The core is ADG. The closure of the core is the entire relation,
so ADG is the only candidate key. This is not in one of the FDs, so it must be added to the
3NF decomposition.
<li>The 3NF give the following decomposition:
<ul>                       
<li><u>AG</u>E
<li><u>EG</u>B
<li><u>D</u>F
<li><u>B</u>C
<li><u>ADG</u>
</ul>
</ol>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring:
<ol>
<li>Split FDs.
<li>(2 points) Minimize FDs.
<li>(3 points) Find candidate keys.
<li>(2 points) Decomposition.
<li>Show primary keys of decomposition.
<li>Include the candidate key in the decomposition.
</ol>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
There are no embedded dependencies so the 3NF decomposition is actually BCNF.
It was not required that this be checked.
</font>
<p>
<li><b>Concurrency</b>. (6 points)
Consider this schedule:
<p>
 <pre>
W<sub>1</sub>(X), W<sub>2</sub>(Y), W<sub>2</sub>(Z), W<sub>1</sub>(Y), R<sub>1</sub>(Z), R<sub>2</sub>(X), C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>
</pre>
<p>
Is this schedule view-serializable? 
If it is view-serializable, show the equivalent serial schedule, and explain why it is equivalent.
If it is not view-serializable, show why.
<p>
<font color="green">
There are 2 transactions, so there are 2 possibly serial schedules.
<ol>
<li>
 <pre>
W<sub>1</sub>(X), W<sub>1</sub>(Y), R<sub>1</sub>(Z), C<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>(Y), W<sub>2</sub>(Z), R<sub>2</sub>(X), C<sub>2</sub>
</pre>
In the serial schedule, the final value of Y is written by transaction 2, but in the original schedule it is written by transaction 1.
So this serial schedule is not view-equivalent.
<li>
 <pre>
W<sub>2</sub>(Y), W<sub>2</sub>(Z), R<sub>2</sub>(X), C<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>1</sub>(X), W<sub>1</sub>(Y), R<sub>1</sub>(Z), C<sub>1</sub>
</pre>
In the serial schedule, the value of X that is read by transaction 2 is the initial value of X,
but in the original schedule transaction 2 reads the value of X written by transaction 1.
So this serial schedule is not view-equivalent.
</ol>
<p>
The schedule is not view-serializable.
</font>
<p>
<li><b>Security</b>. (10 points)
In the Shoe Store database system, the ShoeType and Store tables are publicly readable.
Alice has been hired as the manager of the store at 10 Main Street. Give Alice the ability
to read and write the shoe inventory of the store she manages. Also give Alice the ability
to give these rights to her staff.
<p>
<font color="green">
Since Alice is being given privileges to only part of a table, it is necessary to define
a view of the table. Here is the view:
<pre>
  create view AliceView as
    select i.type, i.store, i.quantity
      from ShoeInventory i, Store s
     where i.store = s.id
       and s.location = '10 Main Street';
</pre>
One can then grant the required privileges with this command:
<pre>
  grant select, update on AliceView to 'Alice' with grant option;
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring:
<ol>
<li>A view is created for Alice.
<li>View selects the columns of ShoeInventory.
<li>View queries from ShoeInventory and Store.
<li>View has the join condition.
<li>View uses the location '10 Main Street'.
<li>The grant command gives select privilege.
<li>The grant command gives update privilege.
<li>The grant command is on the view created for Alice.
<li>The grant command gives privileges to Alice.
<li>The grant command delegates grant privileges.
</ol>
