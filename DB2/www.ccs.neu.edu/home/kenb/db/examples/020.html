  id int primary key,
  address varchar(5000) not null
);
create table Apartment (
  id int primary key,
  number varchar(31) not null,
  building int not null references Building(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(5000) not null
);
create table Owner (
  person int references Person(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  apartment int references Apartment(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(person, apartment)
);
</pre>
