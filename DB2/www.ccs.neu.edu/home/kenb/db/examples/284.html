<center><h1>Specifying Uniqueness Constraints in UML</h1></center>
<p>

Uniqueness constraints are commonly used in relational database systems but are
not often used in software engineering data models.  Primary keys, for example,
are never needed since every class has object identity and associations are
implicitly constrained.  Global uniqueness constraints such as "Every car has a
unique vehicle identification code" are difficult to impose in a software
system.  Unlike a relational database system, there is usually no data
structure in a software system that automatically references all of the objects
of a class.  In Java, for example, if one has a class Car, there is no
automatically defined mechanism for examining all of the objects that are
instances of the class Car.  One could, for example, introduce a static
instance variable of type Set&lt;WeakReference&lt;Car&gt;&gt; such that
whenever an instance of the class Car is constructed, a weak reference is added
to the set.  This would allow checking global constraints such as uniqueness
constraints.  However, this is rarely done in practice.  Aside from the
overhead involved in maintaining the set and the weak references, it is
complicated to use weak references.  For example, if one wished to "delete" an
instance of Car (i.e., remove all references to the instance) and then
construct another one with the same vehicle identification code, one would have
to wait until the "deleted" car object was garbage collected before
constructing the new car object.  Unless the garbage collector is explicitly
invoked, there is no guarantee that a specific object will ever be garbage
collected.

<p>

The example of the Car class should help explain why UML does not directly
support global uniqueness constraints.  This is not a limitation of UML because
one can specify constraints using OCL, either directly on the class or
indirectly using stereotypes.  Here is an example of how one would specify a
uniqueness constraint using a stereotype:

<p>

<center>
<img src="images/286.jpg" alt="Specifying an Organization object to have a unique name"/>
</center>

<p>

In this example one specifies that an organization has a unique name.  Alternatively,
one can use cardinality constraints to specify uniqueness.  The following UML diagram
imposes the same constraint that an organization has a unique name:

<p>

<center>
<img src="images/285.jpg" alt="Specifying an Organization object to have a unique name"/>
</center>

<p>

One other approach for specifying a uniqueness constraint in UML is to use
qualified associations.  A qualified association imposes a local rather than a
global uniqueness constraint.  While this is not the same as a global
uniqueness constraint, it is often more appropriate in practice, and it is easy
to implement in programming languages using existing constructs.  For example,
if we only require that organization names be unique within the state in which
they were incorporated, then this can be specified in UML as follows:

<p>

<center>
<img src="images/287.jpg" alt="Specifying an Organization object to have a unique name within its state"/>
</center>

<p>

In Java, for example, this qualified association can be implemented with an
instance variable of type Map&lt;Organization&gt; in the State class.  In
general, if a global uniqueness constraint is required, it can be specified in
UML by introducing a singular class and a qualified association with the
singular class.

<p>

For a more complex example, consider countries and their parts.  A country may
be divided into parts, such as states, provinces and so on.  These parts may be
subdivided into subparts and so on.  The official name of any part is unique
within its container.  A state name is unique within its country, but need not
be globally unique.  A part can have other names.  A country may be part of one
or more continents.  A person has at least one name and may have a phone
number.  A person can play a role as an official of a part, such as president,
vice-president, and so on.  A part may contain cities, exactly one of which
exactly one is its capital.  The name of a city is unique within its part.
