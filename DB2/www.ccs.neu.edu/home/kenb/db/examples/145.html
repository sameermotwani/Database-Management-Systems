<center><h1>Solution to Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="146.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>
<ol>
<li>What is the relationship between files and indexes?
<p>
An index is a special kind of file that improves retrieval of records in another file.
<li>What is a search key? Explain what it is and what it is used for.
<p>
A search key is usually a sequence of one or more fields of a relation.
It can, in principle, be any search criterion for records in a relation.
It is used for retrieving records in a relation.
<li>What is a hash bucket?
<p>
A hash bucket is the storage area for all entries in a hash table that have the
same value of the hash function.  It consists of a primary disk block and optional
overflow disk blocks.
<li>What is the difference between an internal node and a leaf node of a tree-structured file?
<p>
The lowest level of a tree-structured file consists of the leaf nodes.
The root node is the highest level node.  All other nodes are internal nodes.
<li>How many search keys of a file can be clustered?
<p>
At most one search key can be clustered.
<li>What is the difference between a block and a sector?
<p>
A block is a contiguous sequence of sectors.
A sector is the physical unit of storage for a disk drive.
<li>What is the purpose of the dirty flag?
<p>
The dirty flag is a boolean variable associated with a block in the buffer
that is true if and only if the buffer block differs from the corresponding block on disk.
<li>RAID arrays give better reliability and performance than single disks.
Why would one ever use a single disk?
<p>RAID arrays cost more. If the reliability and performance advantages are not required,
then one will not pay for a RAID array.
<li>What is a buffer replacement policy?
<p>
This is the criterion that is used for determining which buffer block will be
replaced with a different disk page when one runs out of available space in the buffer.
