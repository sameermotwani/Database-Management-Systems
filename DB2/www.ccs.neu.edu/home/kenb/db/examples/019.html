<center><h1>Solution to Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li>This requires two commands: delete existing owners, then insert new ones.
There can be more than one building at 100 Main Street and more than one
apartment numbered 2C. There could also be more than one person named Fred
and more than one person named George.
<p>
<pre>
delete from Owner where exists (
  select *
    from Apartment a, Building b
   where apartment = a.id
     and a.building = b.id
     and a.number = '2C'
     and b.address = '100 Main Street'
);

insert into Owner(person, apartment)
select p.id, a.id
  from Person p, Apartment a, Building b
 where (p.name = 'Fred' or p.name = 'George')
   and a.number = '2C'
   and a.building = b.id
   and b.address = '100 Main Street';
</pre>
<p>
<li>This is the long form. The "distinct" is not required.
<pre>
select distinct b.address
  from Building b, Apartment a, Room r, RoomType t, 
       RoomTypeName n, ApartmentFloor f, Owner o, Person p
 where b.id = a.building
   and a.id = r.apartment
   and r.type = t.id
   and t.id = n.type
   and a.id = f.apartment
   and a.id = o.apartment
   and o.person = p.id
   and r.area > 1000
   and n.name = 'Living Room'
   and f.floor >= 5
   and p.name = 'Fred';
</pre>
<p>
Here is the short form. One can omit the RoomType:
<p>
<pre>
select distinct b.address
  from Building b, Apartment a, Room r, RoomTypeName n, 
       ApartmentFloor f, Owner o, Person p
 where b.id = a.building
   and a.id = r.apartment
   and r.type = n.type
   and a.id = f.apartment
   and a.id = o.apartment
   and o.person = p.id
   and r.area > 1000
   and n.name = 'Living Room'
   and f.floor >= 5
   and p.name = 'Fred';
</pre>
<p>
<li>The 3 rooms must have the same type. So rephrase the query as find
apartments such that there exists a room type such that the apartment
has 3 or more rooms with that type.
<p>
<pre>
select b.address, a.number
  from Building b, Apartment a
 where b.id = a.building
   and exists (
         select *
           from RoomType t
          where 3 <= (select count(*)
                        from Room r
                       where r.type = t.id
                         and r.apartment = a.id)
       );
</pre>
<p>
<li>
Group by building primary key and order by the address.  Some databases are
not smart enough to figure out that address is constant in the b.id groups. For
these, one must group by both b.id and b.address.
<pre>
select b.address, count(*)
  from Building b, Apartment a
 where b.id = a.building
 group by b.id
 order by b.address;
</pre>
</ol>
