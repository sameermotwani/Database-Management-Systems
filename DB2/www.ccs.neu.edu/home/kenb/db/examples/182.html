<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exam</h2></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="183.html">sample exam</a>.
<p>
<ol>
<li><!-- Problem #1 -->(12 points)
A geographer has a database of cities that are located on rivers (and only cities like this).
A city can be located on several rivers, and a river may meet some cities.
Each city has a name, possibly several. A river has a unique name and a length.
A river can be the tributary of another river.
Design a UML class diagram for the database described above.

</ol>
</font>
<p>
<li><!-- Problem #2 -->(17 points)
Here is a data model written in UML:
<p>
<img src="images/232.gif"/>
<p>
Translate this data model to SQL.
<p>
<font color="green">
<pre>
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null unique,
  dob date not null
);
create table Company (
  id int primary key
);
create table CompanyTitle (
  company int,
  foreign key(company) references Company(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  title varchar(255),
  primary key(company, title)
);
create table Employment (
  employs int,
  foreign key(employs) references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  employedBy int,
  foreign key(employedBy) references Company(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  position varchar(255),
  primary key(employs, employedBy)
);
-- The following is not required:
alter table Person
  add foreign key(id) references Employment(employs) on update no action on delete no action;
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="red">
Grading criteria:
<p>
<ol>
<li>create table Person
<li>id int primary key
<li>name is a varchar
<li>name is not null and not primary key
<li>name is unique
<li>dob is a date
<li>dob is not null
<li>create table Company
<li>id int primary key
<li>create table CompanyTitle
<li>company int
<li>company references Company(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
<li>title is a varchar
<li>primary key(company, title)
<li>create table Employment
<li>employs int
<li>employs references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
<li>employedBy int
<li>employedBy references Company(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
<li>position is a varchar
<li>position can be null
<li>primary key(employs, employedBy)
<li>Person.id references Employment(employs)
</ol>
</font>
<p>
<li><!-- Problem #3 -->Here is an SQL schema for tracking the time spent by miners in various mines:
<pre>
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(100)
);
create table Mine (
  designation varchar(100) primary key,
  location varchar(5000) not null
);
create table WorkInterval (
  miner int references Person(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  mine varchar(100) not null references Mine(designation)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  start datetime not null,
  end datetime,
  primary key(miner, start),
  check (end is null or end > start)
);
</pre>
Write the following queries in SQL:
<p>
A. (8 points) For each miner, list the miner's name and the date when the miner first started working in some mine.
<p>
<font color="green">
<pre>
select p.name, min(w.start)
  from Person p, WorkInterval w
 where p.id = w.miner
 group by p.id;
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="red">
Grading criteria:
<p>
<ol>
<li>select p.name
<li>(2 points) select min(w.start)
<li>from Person p
<li>from WorkInterval w
<li>where p.id = w.miner
<li>(2 points) group by p.id
</ol>
</font>
<p>
Some solutions used a nested subquery instead of grouping.
This results in duplication in the result set.
Unfortunately, specifying distinct will remove required duplicates.
<p>
B. (8 points) List the mines by location that have a person named Luis who has worked in the mine.
<p>
<font color="green">
<pre>
select m.location
  from Mine m
 where exists (select *
                 from WorkInterval w, Person p
                where m.designation = w.mine
                  and w.miner = p.id
                  and p.name = 'Luis');
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="red">
Grading criteria:
<p>
<ol>
<li>select m.location
<li>from Mine m
<li>where exists (select *
<li>from WorkInterval w
<li>from Person p
<li>where m.designation = w.mine
<li>and w.miner = p.id
<li>and p.name = 'Luis'
</ol>
</font>
<p>
<li><!-- Problem #4 -->(15 points)
Using the schema in the previous problem,
the following method prints the miners who are currently in a specified mine and how long each has been in the mine (in hours):
 <pre>
public void printWorkingMiners(Connection connection, String mine) throws SQLException {
    long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date now = new Date(currentTime);
    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement
        ("select p.name, p.id, w.start from Person p, WorkInterval w " +
         "where w.miner=p.id and w.mine=? and w.start&lt;? and w.end is null");
</pre>
<font color="blue">
 <pre>
    statement.setString(1, mine);
    statement.setDate(2, now);
    ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) {
        String name = rs.getString(1);
        int id = rs.getInt(2);
        Date start = rs.getDate(3);
</pre>
</font>
 <pre>
        double durationInHours = (currentTime - start.getTime()) / (1000.0 * 3600.0);
        System.out.println(name + " (" + id + ") has been in the mine for " + durationInHours + " hours.");
    }
    statement.close();
}
</pre>
Fill in the missing statements.
</ol>
<p>
<font color="red">
Grading criteria:
<p>
<ol>
<li>(2 points) statement.setString(1, mine);
<li>(2 points) statement.setDate(2, now);
<li>(3 points) ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
<li>(2 points) while (rs.next()) {
<li>(2 points) String name = rs.getString(1);
<li>(2 points) int id = rs.getInt(2);
<li>(2 points) Date start = rs.getDate(3);
</ol>
