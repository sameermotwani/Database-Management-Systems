<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li>A highway network consists of highways.  A position on the
highway is specified by the distance from the beginning of the highway to the
position.  A highway is divided into segments.  Each segment starts where the
previous segment ends.  For each segment, specify where it ends.  Each segment
has a maximum speed and may have a minimum speed.  Highways can intersect
highways.  The location of an intersection is specified by the positions of the
intersection on the two highways that intersect.

<li>A state is keeping track of literacy rates in their districts,
and running programs to improve the literacy rates.  The following is the
UML diagram:
<p>

<p>
Translate this model to the relational model.
<p>
<pre>
create table District(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  literacyRate double
);
create table Person(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null
);
create table Program(
  id int primary key,
  title varchar(255) not null
);
create table Participation(
  assists int references District(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  participatesIn int references Program(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  level enum('Low', 'Medium', 'High') not null,
  primary key(assists, participatesIn)
);
create table Employment(
  worksAtAssists int,
  worksAtParticipatesIn int,
  employs int references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  foreign key(worksAtAssists, worksAtParticipatesIn) references
    Participation(assists, participatesIn) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(worksAtAssists, worksAtParticipatesIn, employs)
);
</pre>
<p>
The next two problems use the following database schema.
The "vin" is the vehicle identification number.
<p>
<pre>
create table Part(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255),
  partOf int,
  foreign key(partOf) references Part(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  madeBy int not null,
  foreign key(madeBy) references Manufacturer(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade  
);
create table Chassis(
  id int primary key,
  vin char(17) not null,
  foreign key(id) references Part(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table Manufacturer(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null
);
</pre>
<p>
<li>Show the name and vin of every chassis that
has a name and that is manufactured by Ford.
<p>
<pre>
select p.name, c.vin
  from Chassis c, Part p, Manufacturer m
 where c.id = p.id
   and p.madeBy = m.id
   and p.name is not null
   and m.name = 'Ford';
</pre>
<p>
<li>List the vin of every chassis manufactured by Ford,
but all of whose parts are manufactured by Fiat.  
List each chassis with this property exactly once.
(Note: Consider only the parts of the chassis, not the parts of
the parts, etc.)
<p>
<pre>
select c.vin
  from Chassis c, Part p, Manufacturer m
 where p.id = c.id
   and p.madeBy = m.id
   and m.name = 'Ford'
   and not exists(
         select *
           from Part q, Manufacturer n
          where q.partOf = p.id
            and q.madeBy = n.id
            and n.name <> 'Fiat'
       );
</pre>
</ol>
