<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Transaction Isolation Level</b>. (8 points)
You wish to determine the current total sales for the stores in a large chain of stores.
What isolation level should be used? 
<p>
Explain the reasons for your choice compared with
the other isolation levels.
<p>
<li><b>Serializability</b>. (8 points)
Three transactions are running concurrently on a database system.
They perform the following actions:
<p><tt>
 T<sub>3</sub>:W(Z), T<sub>2</sub>:R(X), T<sub>2</sub>:W(Y), T<sub>2</sub>:Commit, 
 T<sub>1</sub>:R(Z), T<sub>3</sub>:W(Y), T<sub>3</sub>:Commit, 
 T<sub>1</sub>:W(Y), T<sub>1</sub>:Commit
</tt>
<p>
Determine whether this schedule belongs to each of these classes:
 serializable, conflict-serializable, view-serializable and strict.
Explain why or why not in each case.
<p>
<li><b>Cost of Index Operations</b>. (12 points)
The following table contains author names from 2,000,000 research papers:
<pre>
 create table Researcher(title varchar(250), author varchar(250), 
                         primary key(title, author), index(author));
</pre>
The average length of a title is 90 bytes, the average length of an author is 30 bytes.
The average overhead for each record is 10 bytes. A disk block is 8,192 bytes. A random I/O takes 12ms, and
the time to read one block sequentially is 0.1ms.
On average, each research paper has 10 authors. How many disk blocks are required for
this table? Show your work. 
<p>
Consider both the B-tree file structure and the heap structure. The author
"Albert Finney" occurs in 700 research papers. Is it faster to use the index to find the titles of
these papers or to scan the whole table sequentially? Compute the time required
for each of these and compare them. 
<p>
<li><b>Query Optimization</b>. (12 points)
A database has stores and merchandise. Here is the schema:
<pre>
 create table Store(
   name varchar(100) primary key, 
   location varchar(20) not null, 
   index(location));
 create table Merchandise(
   id int primary key, 
   description varchar(600) not null, 
   index(description),
   availableAt varchar(100),
   foreign key(availableAt) references Store(name) on update cascade on delete set null
);
</pre>
There are 500,000 items of merchandise and 10,000 stores in the database. The average size of a
store record is 50 bytes and the average size of a merchandise record is 100 bytes. Both of these
include the overhead. All indexes are B-trees.
There are 500 locations. You want to find all merchandise items sold in the location "Boston".
Consider the following query evaluation plans:
 <ol>
 <li>Select Boston stores, and then join with Merchandise using an index nested loop join.
<p>
 <li>Select Boston stores, and then join with Merchandise using a sort-merge join.
<p>
 <li>Join Merchandise with Store using an index nested loop and then select the merchandise in Boston stores.
 </ol>
Use the random and sequential I/O times specified in the previous problem.
Discuss the performance of the 3 plans using approximate estimates. Which one is the best?
<p>
<li><b>Physical Database Design</b>. (8 points)
The following is the database design for a film production company. 
An actor is a person, but a person need not be an actor:
<pre>
 create table Person(id int primary key, 
   name varchar(200) not null, position varchar(200));
 create table Actor(id int primary key references Person(id)
     on update cascade on delete cascade,
   biography varchar(65000));
</pre>
In the physical database design we consider whether to denormalize the schema
with a single table as follows:
 <pre>
 create table Person(id int primary key, 
   name varchar(200) not null, position varchar(200),
   isActor boolean not null, biography varchar(65000));
</pre>
Give at least two advantages of each design relative to the other, i.e., four advantages
in all: two in each direction. Be sure to clearly label which one is which. 
<p>
<li><b>Normalization</b>. (12 points)
Normalize the relation ABCDEFG when it satisfies the following functional dependencies:
 <ul>
 <li>E&rarr;G
 <li>AC&rarr;D
 <li>FG&rarr;E
 <li>AFG&rarr;B
 </ul>
Show the list of all candidate keys of the relation.
<p>
Decompose into BCNF if possible.
<p>
If not, then decompose into 3NF.  Show your work.
In your normalization show the attributes in each relation and the primary
key of each relation in the decomposition.
</ol>
