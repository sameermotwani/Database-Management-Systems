<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Part A</h2>
<p>
For the following SQL schema:
<p> 
<pre>
create table Building (
  id int primary key,
  address varchar(750) not null unique,
  photo mediumblob
);
create table Apartment (
  id int primary key,
  number varchar(31) not null,
  building int not null references Building(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  photo mediumblob,
  rent double,
  unique(number, building)
);
create table Room (
  id int primary key,
  area double not null,
  type varchar(50),
  apartment int not null references Apartment(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  photo mediumblob
);
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(5000) not null,
  email varchar(100) not null unique
);
create table Owner (
  person int references Person(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  apartment int references Apartment(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(person, apartment)
);
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Grant the person at email address 'Fred@mail.com' access to the apartment (and room) information
for the apartments that he owns. His username is 'Fred'.
<p><li>Grant the "super" the right to modify all the data associated with the building at "100 Main Street".
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Part B</h2>
<p>
One has a collection of XML documents with information about parts and
their component parts. Here is an example:
<p>
 <pre>
&lt;root>
  &lt;part id='001'>
    &lt;part id='002' attach='rigid' description='top' strength='100'>
      &lt;part id='003' attach='loose' quantity='2'/>
      &lt;part id='004' attach='rigid' strength='50'/>
    &lt;/part>
  &lt;/part>
&lt;/root>
</pre>
<p>
Write XPath queries to extract the following information:
<ol>
<li>The description of the parts attached rigidly with strength at least 100.
<p>
<li>The quantity of loosely attached parts that are part of a top part (i.e., described as 'top').
<p>
</ol>
<p>
For each of the above tasks, you must have an XPath query and a select expression.
<p>
See the <a href="260.html">solution</a>.
