<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
Normalize the following relations when each one satisfies the specified
functional dependencies. Decompose into BCNF if possible. If not, then
decompose into 3NF. Show your work. In particular, show the list of all
candidate keys of the original relation. To compute the candidate keys, use the
discussion in <a href="039.html">Candidate Keys and Normalization</a>. 
In your decomposition show the attributes in each relation as well as the keys and
embedded FDs.
