<center><h2>Candidate Keys and Normalization</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Functional Dependencies</h3>
<p>
Suppose that R is a relation.  A <b>functional dependency</b> (<b>FD</b>) of R
is a requirement X&rarr;A such that X is a set of attributes of R 
whose values determine the attribute A.  
Note that X is a set of attributes, but A is a single attribute.
One can speak of FDs of the form X&rarr;Y where both X and Y are sets of attributes,
but it is easy to see that if X&rarr;Y is true, then X functionally determines
each of the attributes of Y separately (and vice versa), so it is never necessary
to consider FDs where Y is more than a single attribute.
<p>
Another simplification one can make is to remove <b>trivial</b> FDs.  An FD
X&rarr;A is trivial if the attribute A is in X.  Obviously, if one knows the
value of A (as well as other attributes), then one knows the value of A.
<p>
<h3>Candidate Keys</h3>
<p>
A <b>candidate key</b> is a subset of the attributes which uniquely
determines the whole relation and no subset of the candidate key
has this property.  The term "candidate key" is often abbreviated
to simply "key".  A subset of the attributes which uniquely determines
the whole relation (but which need not be minimal) is called a
<b>superkey</b> because it contains (or is equal to) a key.
<p>
Don't confuse this use of the word "key" with
"search key".  A search key is a set of attributes that is indexed
for rapid search. A search key need not be unique.  Unfortunately,
"search key" is also often abbreviated to simply "key".
<p>
The first step in normalization is to find all of the keys of a relation.
Here are some facts that can help find the keys:
<ol>
<li>If an attribute is in none of the FDs,
then it is in every key.
<li>If an attribute occurs on the right-hand side of an FD,
but never occurs on the left-hand side, then it is never in a key.
<li>If an attribute occurs on the left-hand side of an FD,
but never occurs on the right-hand side, then it is in every key.
<li>If an attribute occurs both on the right-hand side an FD and the
left-hand side of an FD, then one cannot say anything about the
attribute.
</ol>
To find the keys, identify which attributes are in each of the
cases above.  The ones in the first and third cases must be in
every key.  Call this set of attributes the <b>core</b>.
Compute the attributes that are determined by the core.
This is called the <b>closure</b> of the core.  If all of the
attributes are in the closure of the core, then the core is not only a
key, it is also the only key.  If the closure of the core is not
the entire set of attributes, then some will be missing.  Write
down this set of attributes, and remove any attribute that is in
the second set above (i.e., it occurs on the right-hand side of an FD, 
but never occurs on the left-hand side).  These are the
<b>exterior</b> attributes. To get a key
one must add one or more exterior attributes to the core.
Accordingly, add them to the core, first one at a time, then two at
a time, and so on, until every key has been found.
<p>
Here are some examples for the relation with attributes ABCD:
<ol>
<li>C&rarr;A, B&rarr;C<br>
 <ol>
 <li>D
 <li>A
 <li>B
 <li>C
 </ol>
The core is BD.  B determines C which determines A, so BD is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>C&rarr;D, C&rarr;A, B&rarr;C<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>AD
 <li>B
 <li>C
 </ol>
The core is B.  B determines C which determines A and D, so B is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>B&rarr;C, D&rarr;A<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>AC
 <li>BD
 <li>empty
 </ol>
The core is BD.  B determines C and D determines A, so BD is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>ABC&rarr;D, D&rarr;A<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>empty
 <li>BC
 <li>AD
 </ol>
The core is BC.  BC does not determine any other attribute.
The exterior attributes are AD.  ABC determines D so it is a key.
BCD determines A so it is also a key.  The only other case
is ABCD but this contains ABC (and also BCD) so it is a superkey and not a key.
So the keys are ABC and BCD.
<li>A&rarr;B, BC&rarr;D, A&rarr;C<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>D
 <li>A
 <li>BC
 </ol>
The core is A.  A determines B and C which determine D, so A is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>AB&rarr;C, AB&rarr;D, C&rarr;A, D&rarr;B<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>empty
 <li>empty
 <li>ABCD
 </ol>
The core is empty.  Every attribute is exterior.
First consider single attributes.  A and B do not determine
any other attribute by themselves.  C determines A, and D determines B.
So no single attribute is a key.  Next consider pairs of attributes.
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Pair of attributes<th>Closure
<tr><td>AB<td>ABCD
<tr><td>AC<td>AC
<tr><td>AD<td>ABCD
<tr><td>BC<td>ABCD
<tr><td>BD<td>BD
<tr><td>CD<td>ABCD
</table>
So AB, AD, BC and CD are keys.
There are no 3-attribute keys because every set of 3 attributes
contains one of the 2-attribute keys.
So there are 4 keys.
</ol>
For the final example, the set of attributes is ABCDEGH and FDs are
AB&rarr;C, AC&rarr;B, AD&rarr;E, BC&rarr;A, E&rarr;G.
<ol>
<li>H
<li>G
<li>D
<li>ABCE
</ol>
The core is HD.  The core does not determine any other attributes.
The exterior attributes are ABCE.  Adding one of these to HD will
not determine the relation, so one must consider all pairs as we
did above.  The result is that ABDH, ACDH and BCDH are the keys.
All 3-attribute subsets of ABCE contain one of the pairs that form keys,
so there are 3 keys.
<p>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>
Candidate keys are closely related to the notion of <b>normal forms</b>.
In the following definitions, remember that we assumed that every FD is
nontrivial and has a single attribute as its right-hand side.  One should
always remove all of the trivial FDs and decompose the FDs that have multiple
attributes for their right-hand side.  Then find all of the keys as discussed
above.  Every key has the property that it determines the entire relation.
So if the left-hand side of an FD is a superkey that properly contains a key, 
then it can be simplified by using any of the keys contained in the superkey.
For example, if BC is key, then one can simplify the ABC&rarr;D to BC&rarr;D.
<p>
Here are the definitions of the normal forms.  Some of these are complicated,
so we give two equivalent definitions for each one.  All higher normal forms
require that the relation be 1NF.  For simplicity, this requirement is not
repeated in the definitions.
<p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="2">
<tr><th><b>Form</b></th><th>Definition</th><th>Equivalent Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>1NF</b></td><td>A relation is in <b>first normal form</b> 
if there are no multi-attributes such as sets or lists.</td>
<td>Every field is atomic.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>2NF</b></td><td>A relation is in <b>second normal form</b> if 
no FD has the form X&rarr;A, where X is a proper subset of a key and
A is not in any key.</td>
<td>For every FD X&rarr;A, either X is not a proper subset of a key or A is in some key.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3NF</b></td><td>A relation is in <b>third normal form</b> 
if no FD has the form X&rarr;A, where X is not a key and A is not in any key.</td>
<td>For every FD X&rarr;A, either X is a key or A is in some key.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>BCNF</b></td><td>A relation is in <b>Boyce-Codd normal form</b> if 
no FD has the form X&rarr;A, where X is not a key.</td>
<td>For every FD X&rarr;A, X is a key.</td></tr>
