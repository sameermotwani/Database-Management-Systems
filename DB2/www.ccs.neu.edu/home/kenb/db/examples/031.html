<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
For the following SQL schema:
<p> 
<pre>
create table Building (
  id int primary key,
  address varchar(750) not null unique,
  photo mediumblob
);

create table Apartment (
  id int primary key,
  number varchar(31) not null,
  building int not null references Building(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  photo mediumblob,
  rent double,
  unique(number, building)
);

create table Room (
  id int primary key,
  area double not null,
  type varchar(50),
  apartment int not null references Apartment(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  photo mediumblob
);
  
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(5000) not null,
  email varchar(100) not null unique
);

create table Owner (
  person int references Person(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  apartment int references Apartment(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(person, apartment)
);
</pre>
<p>
Assume that: the following are the sizes, counts and times:
<ol>
<li>A record requires an average of 6 bytes administrative overhead,
including the space required for specifying the rid.
<li>An int uses 4 bytes.
<li>A double uses 8 bytes.
<li>A building address uses an average of 150 bytes.
<li>An apartment number uses an average of 10 bytes.
<li>A person name or email address uses an average of 25 bytes.
<li>A room type uses an average of 10 bytes.
<li>A photo uses an average of 32K bytes stored separately from the record.
Within the record a photo uses an average of 10 bytes.
<li>There are 20K buildings.
<li>There are 2M apartments and 2M persons.
<li>There are 20M rooms.
<li>There are 20 room types.
<li>On average each apartment is owned by 2 persons.
<li>The disk block size is 8K = 8192 bytes.
<li>A random disk access requires 10ms.
<li>A page can be transferred (read or write) in 0.05 ms = 50 microseconds.
</ol>
<p>
The following are the most frequent queries and updates (with relative frequencies in parentheses):
<ol>
<li>Find an apartment (showing the address, apartment number and room photo) that has
a room of a particular type whose size is at least a specified area. (500)
<li>Find an apartment (showing the address, apartment number and apartment photo) whose
rent is at most a specified amount. (1000)
<li>Add a person to the database. (50)
<li>Add or remove an owner to an apartment, given the building address, apartment number and person name. (100)
</ol>
<p>
The problem is physical database design. In other words, you must determine the
collection of indexes that your database system will be maintaining.
Give suggestions about which indexes might help each of the queries.
For each suggested index
explain why this would or would not be a good choice using the rules of thumb discussed
in class. Be sure to address any trade-offs that might arise.
<p>
Just to make this assignment clear, this is not a query-by-query problem. 
Your objective is to propose a single design that
supports all of the queries. In doing so, you must discuss alternatives,  
but the ultimate objective is to select a single design.
