<center><h2>Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="089.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>

<p>
1.
<pre>
select p.name, o.name
  from Person p, runsFor r, Office o
 where p.memberOf = 'Democrat'
   and p.id = r.person
   and r.office = o.id
</pre>
<p>
2.
<pre>
select w.id, p.id, d.id
  from Ward w, Precinct p, District d, Office o
 where w.precinct = p.id
   and p.district = d.id
   and o.represents = d.id
   and o.id = 15
</pre>

This could be simplified to:

<pre>
select w.id, p.id, p.district
  from Ward w, Precinct p, Office o
 where w.precinct = p.id
   and p.district = o.represents
   and o.id = 15
</pre>
<p>
3.
<pre>
select sum(v.valid), o.name
  from Person p, votes v, Office o
 where v.person = p.id
   and v.office = o.id
   and p.name = 'George'
group by p.id, v.office
</pre>
<p>
4.
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p
 where not exists (select *
                     from Ward w, votes v
                    where v.ward = w.id
                      and v.person = p.id
                      and v.invalid < 5)
</pre>
<p>
One might intuitively think that because two negations "cancel each other out", replacing
"not exists" by "exists" and "v.invalid < 5" by "v.invalid >= 5" will give the same result as above.
In other words, one might think that the following query is equivalent to the one above:
<p>
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p
 where exists (select *
                 from Ward w, votes v
                where v.ward = w.id
                  and v.person = p.id
                  and v.invalid >= 5)
</pre>
<p>
However, ones intuition is wrong in this case, and the two queries are not equivalent.
The first query solves the problem
"Find all persons by name who have at least 5 invalid votes in <i>every</i> ward in which they are running,"
while the second query solves the problem
"Find all persons by name who have at least 5 invalid votes in <i>some</i> ward in which they are running."
So the first query correctly solves the assignment problem while the second query does not.
<p>
In general, the universal quantifier (i.e., "for every") is equivalent to "not exists not".
<p>
5. One way to approach this problem is to rephrase to problem successively until one has a statement that is relatively easy to express in SQL.
The original problem is:
<p>
Find all offices by name that have no invalid votes in any ward. 
<p>
Rephrase this so that "any ward" becomes "for every ward":
<p>
Find all offices by name such that for every ward there are no invalid votes. 
<p>
Now votes are not represented as records in the database. What is represented is a table (called the votes table) that has reports of the
number of valid and invalid votes for a person running for an office in a ward. So rephrase the problem as follows:
<p>
Find all offices by name such that for every ward there are no votes records (for this office) that have invalid votes (i.e., have invalid > 0).
<p>
The next step is to change "for every" to "not exists not".  This changes "for every ward there are no votes records..." to "there does not exist a ward that does not have the property that there are no votes records..." or "there does not exist a ward that has votes records..."
<p>
In logic, the equivalence between "for every" and "not exists not" is often stated as: "for every not" is equivalent to "not exists". That is what happens in this problem.  So the equivalent problem is:
<p>
Find all offices by name such that there does not exist a ward such that there exists a votes record (for this office) that has invalid votes (i.e., have invalid > 0).
<p>
We are now ready to specify this in SQL:
<pre>
select o.name
  from Office o
 where not exists (
    select *
      from Ward w
     where exists (
        select *
          from votes v
         where v.ward = w.id
           and v.office = o.id
           and v.invalid > 0
     )
 )
</pre>
<p>
6.
<pre>
select y.title, p.name, sum(v.valid) + sum(v.invalid) c
  from Party y, Person p, votes v
 where p.party = y.title
   and v.person = p.id
group by y.title, p.id
order by y.title, c, p.name
</pre>
