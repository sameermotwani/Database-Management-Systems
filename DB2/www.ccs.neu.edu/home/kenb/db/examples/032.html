<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="007.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>
We have a database of customer purchases:
<pre>
create table Customer (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  street varchar(255) not null,
  city varchar(255) not null,
  state char(2),
  dob Date
);
create table Purchase (
  id int primary key,
  customer int not null,
  foreign key(customer) references Customer(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  item varchar(255) not null,
  price double not null,
  count int not null default 1,
  cost double not null,
  time DateTime
);
</pre>
<p>
The following are the most frequent queries and updates (with relative frequencies in parentheses):
<ol>
<li>Insert a new purchase by a customer given the customer id and purchase data. (1000)
<p>
<font color="blue">
This only affects the Purchase table. Some mechanism is needed for generating a new purchase id, and the new
purchase data must be inserted into the table. The only index involved is the primary key index of Purchase.
</font>
<p>
<li>Find customer information (id, name, dob, number of purchases) given the customer address (street, city, state). (500)
<p>
<font color="blue">
There are two candidate indexes. The first is on the three columns (street, city, state). Since it is an exact match, a hash index
is sufficient. The second candidate index is on the customer column of Purchase to get the number of purchases. This is an index-only query
since only the number is required. Only an exact match is required so a hash index is sufficient.
</font>
<p>
<li>List all customers (name and dob) ordered by dob and name. (10)
<p>
<font color="blue">
This does not perform any selection, so no index is needed for selecting. However, the query does require
sorting the results. Since a tree index orders its
records, such an index would improve the performance of the query if it was a clustered index on a table that is not
frequently updated, which seems to be the case here.
Unfortunately, most database systems only implement a clustered index on the primary key.
</font>
<p>
<li>Compute the average amount spent by all customers in one state. (10)
<p>
<font color="blue">
This suggests adding a secondary index on the state column. However, the query is not selective enough for the index to be used.
In addition, the query is not used very frequently.
</font>
<p>
<li>List purchase information (id, item, price, count, cost, time) for a specified customer (given the id). (200)
<p>
<font color="blue">
This requires indexing the customer field. Since it is an exact match query, the index can be a hash index.
</font>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
The problem is physical database design. In other words, you must determine the
collection of indexes that your database system will be maintaining.
Give suggestions about which indexes to include in your design. For each suggested index
explain why this would be a good choice using the rules of thumb discussed
in class. Be sure to address any trade-offs that might arise.
<p>
Just to make this assignment clear, this is not a query-by-query problem. 
Your objective is to propose a single design that
supports all of the queries. In doing so, you must discuss alternatives,  
but the ultimate objective is to select a single design.
<p>
<font color="blue">
From the discussion above, we have these candidate indexes and frequencies:
<ol>
<li>Purchase id (1000). This is a primary key so it already has an index.
A hash index is sufficient.
<li>Hash index on (street, city, state) of Customer (500).
<li>Hash index on customer of Purchase (500).
<li>Customer id (200). This is a primary key so it already has an index. 
A hash index is sufficient.
</ol>
<p>
These must be balanced against the update frequency of Purchase. No
updates of Customer were mentioned, so they are not frequent. Therefore,
the cost of adding an index on (street, city, state) is negligible, and
there are significant benefits. The only
candidate index that requires a detailed cost-benefit analysis is the one on 
the customer column of Purchase.
<ul>
<li>If the index is included, then the second query requires 2 random accesses
(1 random access for the Customer record and then 1 random access for the Purchase index record)
However, the secondary index on Purchase will require 2 additional random accesses
for each update of the Purchase table (1 access to read the bucket and 1 to write the bucket). 
There are twice as many updates to this
table as there are occurrences of the second query, so the total is 4 additional random accesses for
updating the Purchase table. Combining this with the first computation, the
cost of the second query requires an average of 6 random accesses.
<li>If the index is not included, then the second query requires a sort-merge of the Customer and Purchase tables
(or more precisely, of one record of the Customer table with the whole Purchase table, so it is just a scan-merge).
This will require a scan of the Purchase table.
Since a sequential access is around 100 times faster than a random access, the
Purchase table would have to be at most 600 blocks (roughly 60,000 records) for
the sort-merge to be faster (assuming 8K blocks).  So the store would have to be quite small for the
sort-merge to be faster. Note that a precise computation of the number of records
is not important. What matters is that it would have to be small.
<li>The fifth query could also make use of the index on the customer field of the Purchase table.
However, this is a less convincing argument.  Each purchase record of a customer would require a random access.
For example, if there were 1000 customers, each of whom made an average of 60 purchases, then the Purchase table
uses 600 blocks.  A sequential scan of these blocks would take much less time than 60 random accesses, so it
would be faster not to use the index even if there is one.  More generally, there would need to be substantially
more than 10,000 customers for the index to be useful for this query even when we do not include the cost of
maintaining the index.
</ul>
<p>
Assuming that the database is not very small,
here is the recommended index design:
<ol>
<li>Customer table: hash index on the primary key, hash index on (street, city, state).
<li>Purchase table: hash index on the primary key, hash index on customer column.
</ol>
