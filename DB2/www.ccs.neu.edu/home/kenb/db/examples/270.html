Some UML associations can be represented as UML attributes.  For example, the following association
<center><img src="images/271.jpg" alt="Takes Association"/></center>
could be represented using an attribute as follows:
<center><img src="images/272.jpg" alt="Takes Attribute"/></center>
<p>
Note that the multiplicity of the association on the Student side (i.e., the "is taken by" side)
must be 0..*.  An association with some other multiplicity on this side cannot be expressed as an attribute.
