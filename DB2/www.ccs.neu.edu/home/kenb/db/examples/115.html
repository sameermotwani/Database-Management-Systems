<center><h2>Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
Normalize the following relations.  Decompose into BCNF if possible.
If not, then decompose into 3NF.  Show your work.  In particular,
show the list of all candidate keys of the original relation.  To compute the
candidate keys, use the discussion in <a href="102.html">Candidate Keys</a>.
In your decomposition show the attributes in each relation and the primary
key of each relation.  Do not show any foreign key constraints.
<ol>
<li>Relation has attributes ICNT.  The FD is N&rarr;CT.
<li>Relation has attributes WHOSE.  The FDs are WH&rarr;S, HOS&rarr;E.
<li>Relation has attributes ABCDEFG.  The FDs are AB&rarr;F, AD&rarr;E, F&rarr;G.
<li>Relation has attributes ABCD.  The FDs are ABC&rarr;D, D&rarr;A.
</ol>
