<p>
<ol>
<li>(10 points)

A contract is an agreement between exactly 2 parties. A contract consists
of one or more clauses. A clause has a text and may contain subclauses.
A party is either a person or a corporation. A corporation has names.
A person may have an address.

Translate the following UML diagram to an SQL schema:
<p>
<img src="images/252.gif" alt="UML Diagram"/>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<pre>
  create table Counselor(
    id int primary key,
    title varchar(200) not null);
  create table Client(
    id int primary key,
    name varchar(200) not null);
  create table Meeting(
    /* If either a client or a counselor is deleted or updated, all meetings
       are also deleted or updated because Meeting is an association between
       Counselor and Client. */
    sees int references Client(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
    meetsWith int references Counselor(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
    primary key(sees, meetsWith));
  create table MeetingDay(
    sees int,
    meetsWith int,
    day enum('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday'),
    /* If a meeting is deleted or updated, the days are also deleted or updated
       because they implement a multi-valued attribute of Meeting. */
    foreign key(sees, meetsWith) references Meeting(sees, meetsWith) on delete cascade on update cascade,
    primary key(sees, meetsWith, day));
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="red">
Note that the foreign key of MeetingDay is the primary key of Meeting,
so one cannot use the abbreviation for specifying a foreign key in this case. Specifying
separately that MeetingDay.sees and MeetingDay.meetsWith are foreign keys is wrong.
It would allow one to specify a MeetingDay that does not correspond to a Meeting.

<ol type="i">
<li>create table Counselor
<li>Counselor.id int primary key
<li>Counselor.title varchar(200)
<li>Counselor.title is not null
<li>create table Client
<li>Client.id int primary key

</ol>

<li>(22 points overall)

This is the schema for a database of paint and colors:
<pre>
create table Color(
  name varchar(100) primary key
);
create table Texture(
  type varchar(20) primary key,
  description varchar(255)
);
create table Paint(
  sku int primary key,
  price double not null,
  maker varchar(100) not null,
  color varchar(100) references Color(name)
   on update cascade on delete no action,
  texture varchar(20) references Texture(type)
   on update cascade on delete no action
);
</pre>
<p>
Express the following queries in SQL:

<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>(12 points)
List all paint color names that have the letter "z" and the number of textures that are available for that color.
<p>
<font color="red">
One must be careful in this query to be sure that colors with no paints are listed with a count of 0.
One must also be careful to avoid overcounting the number of textures. There could be several Paint
records with the same color and texture but each texture should be counted only once.
Here is the simplest solution:
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<pre>
  select c.name, count(distinct p.texture)
    from Color c left join Paint p on (c.name = p.color)
   where c.name like '%z%'
   group by c.name;
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="red">
Alternatively, one can avoid the outer join by using a union of two
queries. The first handles the case in which a paint exists, and the
second handles the case in which a paint does not exist. In the former
case, no join is required. For the latter case, one must use a subquery:
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<pre>
  select p.color, count(distinct p.texture)
    from Paint p
   where p.color like '%z%'
   group by p.color
 union all
  select c.name, 0
    from Color c
   where c.name like '%z%'
     and not exists (
         select *
           from Paint p
          where p.color = c.name
        );
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="green">
Grading criteria:
<ul>
<li>(1.5 points) select c.name [or p.color]
<li>(2 points) select count(texture)
<li>(1.5 points) from Color c
<li>(2 points) left join of Color with Paint p
<li>(1.5 points) join condition for Color and Paint
<li>(2 points) where c.name [or p.color] like '%z%'
<li>(1.5 points) group by c.name [or p.color]
</ul>
</font>
<p>
<li>(10 points)
Find all distinct textures, showing their type and description, for yellow, that cost less than $10.
<font color="blue">
<pre>
  select distinct t.type, t.description
    from Texture t, Paint p
   where t.type = p.texture
     and p.color = 'yellow'
     and p.price < 10;
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="green">
Grading criteria (1.25 points each):
 <pre>
<ul>
<li>select distinct
<li>select t.type
<li>select t.description
<li>from Texture t
<li>from Paint p
<li>where t.type = p.texture
<li>where p.color = 'yellow'
<li>where p.price < 10
</ul>
</pre>
</font>
</ol>
<p>
<li>(16 points) The following method finds a paint having the lowest price for a specified color and texture type.
It prints the price, sku and maker for one paint having the lowest price.
<p>
 <pre>
  public void printALowestPricePaint(String color, String texture) {
    PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(
      "select p.sku, p.price, p.maker from Paint p" +
      " where p.color=? and p.texture=?"
    );
<font color="blue">
    ps.setString(1, color);
    ps.setString(2, texture);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    double lowestPrice = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    int sku;
    String maker;
    while (rs.next()) {
      double price = rs.getDouble(2);
      if (price < lowest) {
        lowest = price;
        sku = rs.getInt(1);
        maker = rs.getString(3);
      }
    }
    if (lowestPrice < Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) {
      System.out.println(lowest + " " + sku + " " + maker);
    } else {
      System.out.println("The color/texture combination is not available.");
    }
</font>
  }
</pre>
<p>
<font color="red">
The most common mistake was to omit dealing with the case when there are no paints for the specified color and texture combination.
</font>
<p>
<font color="green">
Grading criteria (1.46 points each):
 <pre>
<ol type="i">
<li>ps.setString(1, color);
<li>ps.setString(2, texture);
<li>ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
<li>initialize a variable that will have the lowest price
<li>while (rs.next())
<li>double price = rs.getDouble(2);
<li>check for lower price
<li>sku = rs.getInt(1);
<li>maker = rs.getString(3);
<li>System.out.println(lowest + " " + sku + " " + maker);
<li>The case of a color and texture for which there is no paint was properly handled.
