<center><h1>Criteria for data modeling notation</h1></center>
<p>
Virtually every database textbook uses ER notation (or some variation of ER
notation such as "crowsfoot" or EER diagrams) for database design.
On the web, one finds many
misconceptions and misleading statements about ER. In some cases, the
statements are simply wrong, representing commonly held beliefs that either
have no basis in fact at all or have never be tested. For example, it is often
claimed that the UML class diagram was derived from ER. In fact, UML was
derived from the notations of Booch and Rumbaugh, both of which arose from 
notations that predate the ER notation. The ER notation seems to have been
derived from Bachmann diagrams, which are unrelated to the Booch and Rumbaugh
diagrams.
</p><p>
The following discussion is an effort to clarify the advantages and
disadvantages of UML class diagrams versus ER.
</p><p>
<ol>
<li><b>Standards.</b> 
The issue is whether a notation is an industry standard (either de jure or de
facto) rather than vendor- and/or product-specific notation. ER is completely
nonstandard. There is a very large variety of notations that claim to be ER
notation.  It is dependent not only on the vendor but also on the
product. UML is not dependent on either a vendor or a product.
</li><li><b>Use in Industry.</b>
The issue is whether industry actually uses a notation for their software
projects.  In Brodie and Liu [1], a recent survey of 10 randomly chosen large
corporations did not find a single example of the use of ER modeling.  By
contrast, UML is ubiquitous in industry, frequently being used even in projects
that are unrelated to software development.  A very different picture emerges
when one looks at database textbooks.  I know of only a couple of database
textbooks that have more than a brief reference to UML, and only a single
database textbook that uses UML as its only data modeling language.  Clearly,
there is a deep and wide chasm between academics and industry when it comes to data
modeling.
</li><li><b>Programming language compatibility.</b>
This is important when databases are accessed via a programming
language. Object-relational mapping frameworks such as Hibernate and JPA are
increasingly important. UML can be used to generate code for such
applications. ER is of no use for this purpose.
<ul>
<li><b>Tool support.</b>
UML has excellent and widespread tool support in the
 industry. ER is also supported but only within the confines of the database
 industry so it is not as widespread.
</li><li><b>Code generation.</b>
UML has excellent code generation support. ER has none.
</li><li><b>Client development.</b>
UML is compatible with Hibernate, JPA and other
 frameworks for client development. ER is not.
</li></ul>
</li><li><b>Compatibility with other notations.</b>
UML is integrated with a large number of other diagram notations. This is
important for modern software development.  ER diagrams are completely
isolated.  Not only are they incompatible with other notations, they are even
incompatible with other types of ER diagram.
</li><li><b>Notational simplicity.</b>
Arguably, UML is much simpler and more compact.  ER
has a separate bubble for every attribute which makes even small designs into
huge diagrams. Cardinality constraints and association classes are considerably
more compact and cleaner in UML. Some ER diagram notations have adopted the UML
notations which suggests that ER will eventually be subsumed by UML.
</li><li><b>Interoperability.</b>
An ER diagram of one type is rarely interoperable with
one of another type, other than by manual translation. UML diagrams can be
downloaded in XMI format and uploaded to another UML tool.
</li><li><b>Semantics.</b>
This issue concerns whether the notation has explicit formal semantics or just
implicit and/or informal semantics. UML has not been completely specified
formally, but it is in the process of being formally specified, and class
diagrams are already finished. ER diagrams have no formal semantics other than
their translation to the relational model which does have formal semantics.
Unfortunately, this is only implicit, and one has access to it only if one can
obtain the source code of the translator.  Moreover, since the translation is
always to a specific database system, the semantics are further complicated by
the fact that database systems do not entirely conform to either the relational
model or to the SQL standard.
</li><li><b>Object-Orientation.</b>
UML is fully object-oriented. ER has none of the critical object-oriented
features: object identity, encapsulation and data hiding.  Because the
relational model does not have these features, translations from UML to the
relational model will necessarily make some compromises.  However, this is no
worse than the compromises that typically occur when compiling a programming
language to machine code since machine code also does not have the critical
object-oriented features.  While ER has been extended to include some of the
peripheral object-oriented features such as inheritance, the fact that the
relational model has no support for these features makes these extensions
dubious at best (since the semantics of ER is not defined independently,
but rather defined in terms of the relational model).
