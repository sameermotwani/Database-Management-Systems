<p>
Here is a data model for musical instruments and compositions:
<p>
<img src="images/231.jpg" alt="Data Model"/>
<p>
Note that in this data model, persons need not have unique names,
and musical instruments may not have unique names.
The abbreviation "dob" stands for "date of birth".
<p>
The schema for this data model is the following:
<p>
<pre>
create table Person(
  id int primary key,
  dob date not null,
  name varchar(255) not null
);
create table Composition(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null unique,
  duration int not null,
  composedBy int,
  foreign key(composedBy) references Person(id) on update cascade on delete set null
);
create table Instrument(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  musicalKey varchar(255)
);
create table usesInstrument(
  isUsedBy int,
  foreign key(isUsedBy) references Composition(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  uses int,
  foreign key(uses) references Instrument(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  count int not null,
  primary key(isUsedBy, uses)
);

create table User(
  beingUsedComposition int,
  beingUsedInstrument int,
  foreign key(beingUsedComposition, beingUsedInstrument) references usesInstrument(isUsedBy, uses)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  user int,
  foreign key(user) references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(beingUsedComposition, beingUsedInstrument, user)
);

create table StringInstrument(
  id int primary key,
  foreign key(id) references Instrument(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  numberOfStrings int not null
);
create table BrassInstrument(
  id int primary key,
  foreign key(id) references Instrument(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  numberOfValves int not null
);
create table PercussionInstrument(
  id int primary key,
  foreign key(id) references Instrument(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);

-- The following is not required:

alter table Composition
  add foreign key(id) references usesInstrument(isUsedBy) on update no action on delete no action;
</pre>
<p>
For each of the following queries, give the relational algebra expression:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find all distinct names of instruments in the key of C in descending alphabetical order.
<p>
<pre>
select i.name
  from Instrument i
 where i.musicalKey = "C"
 order by i.name desc;
</pre>
<li>Find all compositions and their composers (both by name) that use an instrument whose name begins with "o"
<p>
<pre>
select c.name, p.name
  from Composition c, Person p, usesInstrument u, Instrument i
 where c.composedBy = p.id
   and u.uses = i.id
   and u.isUsedBy = c.id
   and i.name like 'o%';
</pre>
<p>
<li>Find the names of composers who never use a percussion instrument.
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p
 where not exists (
         select *
           from Composition c, usesInstrument u, PercussionInstrument pi
          where c.composedBy = p.id
            and u.isUsedBy = c.id
            and u.uses = pi.id
       );
</pre>
<p>
<li>Find all compositions by name that were not composed by a person who was born in the 20th century.
<pre>
select c.name
  from Composition c
 where not exists (
         select *
           from Person p
          where c.composedBy = p.id
            and p.dob >= '1900-01-01'
            and p.dob < '2000-01-01'
       );
</pre>
<li>This is an alternative solution to the above query:
<pre>
select c.name
  from Composition c
 where c.composedBy is null
union
select c.name
  from Composition c, Person p
 where c.composedBy = p.id
   and (p.dob < '1900-01-01' or p.dob >= p.dob >= '2000-01-01');
</pre>
<p>
<li>Find the names of instruments used by all the compositions that are at least an hour long.
<p>
<pre>
select i.name
  from Instrument i
 where not exists (
         select *
           from Composition c
          where c.duration >= 60
            and not exists (
                  select *
                    from usesInstrument u
                   where u.uses = i.id
                     and u.isUsedBy = c.id
                )
       );
</pre>
<p>
<li>Using table constraints (CHECK clauses), modify the schema above so that every composition uses at least two instruments and a composition can be composed by up to 2 composers (at most 2 composers).
<p>
<li>Write a program that does the following:
 <ol>
 <li>connect to a database;
 <li>create the schema shown above;
 <li>populate your database with compositions by Bach, Vivaldi and Hayden; and
 <li>run the queries above.
 </ol>
</ol>
