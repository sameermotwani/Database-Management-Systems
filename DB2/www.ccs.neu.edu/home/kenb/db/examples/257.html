<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
Consider the following schema:
<p>
<pre>
create table Company(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(500) not null,
  product varchar(500)
);
create table Person(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(200) not null,
  worksFor int,
  foreign key (worksFor) references Company(id) on update cascade on delete no action
);
create table Department(
  id int primary key,
  honors int,
  foreign key (honors) references Company(id) on update cascade on delete no action
);
create table DepartmentName(
  department int,
  name varchar(255),
  primary key(department, name),
  foreign key (department) references Department(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table Student(
  id int primary key,
  class varchar(50),
  major int,
  foreign key (id) references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  foreign key (major) references Department(id) on update cascade on delete set null
);
create table Sponsor(
  isSponsoredBy int,
  sponsors int,
  primary key(isSponsoredBy, sponsors),
  foreign key (isSponsoredBy) references Company(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  foreign key (sponsors) references Department(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
</pre>
<p>
<ol>
<li>It is required that there is a company named IBM in the database.
 <pre>
create assertion IBMisCompany check
  exists (
    select *
      from Company c
     where c.name = 'IBM'
  );
</pre>
<li>Require that every company has at least one person who works for the company.
 <pre>
create assertion CompanyHasAWorker check
  not exists (
    select *
      from Company c
     where not exists (
             select *
               from Person p
              where p.worksFor = c.id
           )
  );
</pre>
<p>
The assertion above could also be expressed as a check constraint.
<p>
<pre>
alter table Company
  add constraint CompanyHasAWorker check(
    exists(
      select *
        from Person p
       where p.worksFor = id
    )
  )
</pre>
</ol>
