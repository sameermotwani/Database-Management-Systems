<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
For the following SQL schema:
<p> 
<pre>

create table Address (
  street varchar(100),
  city varchar(100),
  state char(2),
  zipcode char(5),
  primary key(street, city, state),
  unique(street, zipcode)
);

create table Building (
  id int primary key,
  street varchar(100) not null,
  city varchar(100) not null,
  state char(2) not null,
  foreign key (street, city, state) references Address (street, city, state)
    on update cascade on delete no action
);

create table Apartment (
  id int primary key,
  number varchar(31) not null,
  containedIn int not null references Building
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  area double,
  roomCount int,
  check (roomCount > 0)
);

create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(1000) not null,
  street varchar(100) not null,
  city varchar(100) not null,
  state char(2) not null,
  foreign key (street, city, state) references Address (street, city, state)
    on update cascade on delete no action
);

create table Owner (
  ownedBy int references Person
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  owns int references Apartment
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  start date not null,
  end date,
  primary key(ownedBy, owns)
);
</pre>
<p>
Show how to do the following using SQL:
<p>
<ol>
<li>List the current owners (by name) of any apartment in zipcode 02115. It is okay to list an owner more than once.
<li>Same as above, but do not list an owner more than once. Note that names may not be unique.
<li>Show the apartments by number and building id that have at least one owner whose address is in a different state than the apartment.
    Do not list an apartment more than once.
<li>End the ownerships of apartments by anyone named Steve.
<li>List all buildings by id and full address that have more than 20 apartments.
<li>List the apartments that have more than 6 rooms, in order by their number and building id. Also show the number of current owners of the apartment.
</ol>
