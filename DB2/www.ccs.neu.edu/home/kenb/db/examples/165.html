<center><h1>Solution to Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="166.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>
Design the following queries for the composition schema in <a href="168.html">Sample Exercise</a>.
In every case the result of the query should have no duplicates.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find the bands by name that have a percussionist (i.e., a person who plays a percussion instrument).
<pre>
select b.name
  from Band b
 where exists (
         select *
           from memberOf m, plays p, PercussionInstrument pi
          where m.band = b.id
            and m.musician = p.musician
            and p.instrument = pi.id
       );
</pre>
One can also perform the query without a nested query as follows:
<pre>
select distinct b.name
  from Band b, memberOf m, plays p, PercussionInstrument pi
 where m.band = b.id
   and m.musician = p.musician
   and p.instrument = pi.id;
</pre>
<p>
<li>Find the names of the persons who are not a member of an indie pop band.
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p
 where not exists (
         select *
           from memberOf m, Band b
          where m.musician = p.id
            and m.band = b.id
            and b.style = 'indie pop'
       );
</pre>
<p>
<li>Find the names of the persons who are members of every indie pop band.
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p
 where not exists (
         select *
           from Band b
          where b.style = 'indie pop'
            and not exists (
                  select *
                    from memberOf m
                   where m.musician = p.id
                     and m.band = b.id
                )
       );
</pre>
<p>
<li>Design a trigger that will automatically delete any updated instrument that no longer has a key
(i.e., had a key before the update, but now does not have a key).
<pre>
create trigger InstrumentTrigger after update on Instrument
  for each row 
    delete from Instrument
     where new.id = id
       and old.musicalKey is not null
       and new.musicalKey is null;
</pre>
</ol>
