  create table Counselor(
    id int primary key,
    title varchar(200) not null);

<p>
Assume the following are the sizes, counts and times:
<ul>
<li>A record requires an average of 10 bytes administrative overhead,
including the space required for specifying the rid.
<li>An int uses 4 bytes.
<li>A double uses 8 bytes.
<li>A Date or day uses 8 bytes on average.
<li>A title uses 100 bytes on average. The title is nearly unique.
<li>A name uses 50 bytes on average. The name is nearly unique.
<li>The average text size is 2500 bytes.
<li>There are 100 counselors.
<li>There are 5K clients.
<li>There are 10K meetings.
<li>There are 15K meeting days.
<li>There are 2M notes.
<li>The disk block size is 8K = 8192 bytes.
<li>A random disk access requires 5ms.
<li>A page can be transferred (read or write) in 0.1 ms = 100 microseconds.
</ul>
<p>
Compute the number of blocks required for storing each of the tables in the database
using each of the following 3 table structures:
<ol type="A">
<li>Clustered Heap.  An unordered collection of records packed into sequential blocks.
<li>Clustered Sort.  An ordered collection of records packed into sequential blocks.
In each case, order it by the primary key.
<li>Clustered B-tree.  The ordering and clustering is by the primary key.
</ol>
<p>
Compute the time required for each of the following tasks using each of the 3 table
structures. In each case, all of the tables are implemented with the same table structure.
<ol>
<li>List all clients (by name) that meet with a counselor specified by id.
<li>List the days that a client (specified by id) meets with a counselor (specified by id).
<li>Add a new note.
<li>Delete a meeting day for a client (specified by id).
</ol>
