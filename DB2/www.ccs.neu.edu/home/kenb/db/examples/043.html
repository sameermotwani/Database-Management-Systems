<center><h2>Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li>(14 points) 
In an appointment calendar there are periodic events but there can
be exceptions (e.g., an event that occurs every month except for December 2010).
Design a data model in UML for events. Some events are periodic. Events
have descriptions and periodic events have a period. Assume you have a
type Duration for a period of time. A periodic event can have exceptions.
An exception has a date and may have a reason.
<p>

<p>
Elements in the UML diagram:
<ol>
<li>Event class
<li>description attribute of Event
<li>Periodic Event class
<li>period attribute of Periodic Event
<li>period has type Duration
<li>Exception class
<li>date attribute of Exception class
<li>date has type Date
<li>reason attribute of Exception class
<li>reason attribute has multiplicity [0..1]
<li>Periodic Event is subclass of Event
<li>Association between Periodic Event and Exception
<li>Cardinality constraint of Periodic Event end is 1..1
<li>Cardinality constraint of Exception end is 0..*
</ol>
<p>
<li>(18 points)
Here is a data model written in UML:
<p>
<img src="images/226.jpg" alt="Security Domain Model"/>
<p>
Translate this data model to SQL.
<pre>
create table SecurityDomain (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null unique
);
create table DomainOwner (
  domain int,
  foreign key(domain) references SecurityDomain(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  owner varchar(255),
  primary key(domain, owner)
);
create table Resource (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  belongsTo int,
  foreign key(belongsTo) references SecurityDomain(id) on update cascade on delete set null
);
</pre>
<p>
<li>Here is an SQL schema:
<pre>
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(100)
);
create table Instrument (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(100) not null unique
);
create table plays (
  person int,
  foreign key(person) references Person(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  instrument int,
  foreign key(instrument) references Instrument(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(person, instrument)
);
create table playsSong (
  person int,
  instrument int,
  foreign key(person, instrument) references plays(person, instrument) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  song varchar(200),
  primary key (person, instrument, song)
);
</pre>
Write the following queries in SQL:
<ol>
<li>(10 points) Find the persons by name who play 'Quiet City' on a trumpet.
<p>
There are several variations on this query depending on the simplifications
one applies. The one with all of the tables is the following:
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p, Instrument i, plays y, playsSong s
 where p.id = y.person
   and i.id = y.instrument
   and y.person = s.person
   and y.instrument = s.instrument
   and s.song = 'Quiet City'
   and i.name = 'trumpet'
</pre>
<p>
Note that there are 4 join conditions even though there are 4 tables.
The reason why there are 4 is that one of the foreign key constraints
involves two columns.
<p>
If one uses the foreign key constraint of playsSong to eliminate
the plays table one has this query:
<pre>
select p.name
  from Person p, Instrument i, playsSong s
 where p.id = s.person
   and i.id = s.instrument
   and s.song = 'Quiet City'
   and i.name = 'trumpet'
</pre>
<p>
<li>(18 points) Find the instruments that are never used for the song named 'Moldau'.
<pre>
select i.id
  from Instrument i
 where not exists (
         select *
           from playsSong s
          where s.song = 'Moldau'
            and i.id = s.instrument
       )
</pre>
</ol>
</ol>
