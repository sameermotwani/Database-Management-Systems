<center><h2>Candidate Keys</h2></center>
<p>
A <b>candidate key</b> is a subset of the attributes which uniquely
determines the whole relation and no subset of the candidate key
has this property.  The term "candidate key" is often abbreviated
to simply "key".  (Don't confuse this use of the word "key" with
"search key".  A search key is a set of attributes that is indexed
for rapid search. A search key need not be unique.  Unfortunately,
"search key" is also often abbreviated to simply "key".)
A subset of the attributes which uniquely determines
the whole relation (but which need not be minimal) is called a
<b>superkey</b> because it contains (or is equal to) a key.
The first step in normalization is to find all of the keys of a relation.
Here are some facts that can help find the keys:
<ol>
<li>If an attribute is in none of the functional dependencies,
then it is in every key.
<li>If an attribute occurs on the right-hand side of a functional
dependency, but never occurs on the left-hand side, then it is
never in a key.
<li>If an attribute occurs on the left-hand side of a functional
dependency, but never occurs on the right-hand side, then it is
in every key.
</ol>
To find the keys, identify which attributes are in each of the
cases above.  The ones in the first and third cases must be in
every key.  Call this set of attributes the <b>core</b>.
Compute the attributes that are determined by the core.
This is called the <b>closure</b> of the core.  If all of the
attributes are in the closure of the core, then the core is not only a
key, it is also the only key.  If the closure of the core is not
the entire set of attributes, then some will be missing.  Write
down this set of attributes, and remove any attribute that is in
the second set above (i.e., it occurs on the right-hand side of a functional
dependency, but never occurs on the left-hand side).  These are the
<b>exterior</b> attributes. To get a key
one must add one or more exterior attributes to the core.
Accordingly, add them to the core, first one at a time, then two at
a time, and so on, until every key has been found.
<p>
Here are some examples for the relation with attributes ABCD:
<ol>
<li>C&rarr;A, B&rarr;C<br>
 <ol>
 <li>D
 <li>A
 <li>B
 </ol>
The core is BD.  B determines C which determines A, so BD is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>C&rarr;D, C&rarr;A, B&rarr;C<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>AD
 <li>B
 </ol>
The core is B.  B determines C which determines A and D, so B is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>B&rarr;C, D&rarr;A<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>AC
 <li>BD
 </ol>
The core is BD.  B determines C and D determines A, so BD is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>ABC&rarr;D, D&rarr;A<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>empty
 <li>BC
 </ol>
The core is BC.  BC does not determine any other attribute.
The exterior attributes are AD.  ABC determines D so it is a key.
BCD determines A so it is also a key.  The only other case
is ABCD but this contains ABC (and also BCD) so it is a superkey and not a key.
So the keys are ABC and BCD.
<li>A&rarr;B, BC&rarr;D, A&rarr;C<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>D
 <li>A
 </ol>
The core is A.  A determines B and C which determine D, so A is a key.
Therefore it is the only key.
<li>AB&rarr;C, AB&rarr;D, C&rarr;A, D&rarr;B<br>
 <ol>
 <li>empty
 <li>empty
 <li>empty
 </ol>
The core is empty.  Every attribute is exterior.
First consider single attributes.  A and B do not determine
any other attribute by themselves.  C determines A, and D determines B.
So no single attribute is a key.  Next consider pairs of attributes.
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Pair of attributes<th>Determined attributes
<tr><td>AB<td>ABCD
<tr><td>AC<td>AC
<tr><td>AD<td>ABCD
<tr><td>BC<td>ABCD
<tr><td>BD<td>BD
<tr><td>CD<td>ABCD
</table>
So AB, AD, BC and CD are keys.
There are no 3-attribute keys because every set of 3 attributes
contains one of the 2-attribute keys.
So there are 4 keys.
</ol>
For the final example, the set of attributes is ABCDEGH and FDs are
AB&rarr;C, AC&rarr;B, AD&rarr;E, BC&rarr;A, E&rarr;G.
<ol>
<li>H
<li>G
<li>D
</ol>
The core is HD.  The core does not determine any other attributes.
The exterior attributes are ABCE.  Adding one of these to HD will
not determine the relation, so one must consider all pairs as we
did above.  The result is that ABDH, ACDH and BCDH are the keys.
All 3-attribute subsets of ABCE contain one of the pairs that form keys,
so there are 3 keys.
