<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
This is a solution to a <a href="091.html">sample exercise</a>.
<p>
<h3>Part A.</h3>
<p>
Answer Exercise 17.2 in the textbook but only for the classes:
serializable, conflict-serializable, view-serializable and strict.
<p>
<h3>Part B.</h3>
<p>
Show the optimized query evaluation plans for the following schema and queries.
For each query show at least two reasonable evaluation plans, and for each
plan show your computation of the estimated time required to evaluate the
query using the plan. 
The schema is the one in <a href="090.html">Assignment #4</a>
<p>
<pre>
create table Person(
  id int,
  primary key(id) using hash, -- [count 10K]
  dob date not null,
  name varchar(255) not null
);
create table Composition(
  name varchar(255),
  primary key(name) using hash, -- [count 100K]
  duration int not null,
  composedBy int references Person(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table Instrument(
  id int,
  primary key(id) using hash, -- [count 1K]
  name varchar(255) not null,
  index (name) using btree, -- [nearly unique]
  musicalKey varchar(255),
  index (musicalKey) using hash -- [count 100]
);
create table usesInstrument(
  composition varchar(255) references Composition(name)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  instrument int references Instrument(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  count int not null,
  primary key(composition, instrument) using btree -- [count 1M] 
);

create table StringInstrument(
  id int,
  primary key(id) using hash, -- [count 500]
  foreign key(id) references Instrument(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,

<li>Find all distinct names of instruments in the key of C in descending alphabetical order.
<p>
<pre>
select i.name
  from Instrument i
 where i.musicalKey = 'C# minor'
 order by i.name desc
</pre>
<p>
The B-tree on Instrument.name maintains the instruments in order by name so it is only
necessary to reverse the order. The musicalKey column is not indexed so one can only
perform the selection by scanning. So the 
<li>Find all compositions and their composers that use an instrument whose name begins with "o"

   and i.name like 'o%'
</pre>
<p>
<li>Find all compositions that were not composed by a person who was born in the 20th century.

  from Composition c, Person p
