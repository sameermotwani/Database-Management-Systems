<center><h2>Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
We have a database of customer purchases:
<pre>
create table Customer (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(255) not null,
  street varchar(255) not null,
  city varchar(255) not null,
  state char(2),
  dob Date
);
create table Purchase (
  id int primary key,
  customer int not null,
  foreign key(customer) references Customer(id) on update cascade on delete no action,
  item varchar(255) not null,
  price double not null,
  count int not null default 1,
  cost double not null,
  time DateTime
);
</pre>
<p>
The following are the most frequent queries and updates (with relative frequencies in parentheses):
<ol>
<li>Insert a new purchase by a customer given the customer id and purchase data. (1000)
<li>Find customer information (id, name, dob, number of purchases) given the customer address (street, city, state). (500)
<li>List all customers (name and dob) ordered by dob and name. (10)
<li>Compute the average amount spent by all customers in one state. (10)
<li>List purchase information (id, item, price, count, cost, time) for a specified customer (given the id). (200)
</ol>
<p>
The problem is physical database design. In other words, you must determine the
collection of indexes that your database system will be maintaining.
Give suggestions about which indexes to include in your design. For each suggested index
explain why this would be a good choice using the rules of thumb discussed
in class. Be sure to address any trade-offs that might arise.
<p>
Just to make this assignment clear, this is not a query-by-query problem. 
Your objective is to propose a single design that
supports all of the queries. In doing so, you must discuss alternatives,  
but the ultimate objective is to select a single design.
