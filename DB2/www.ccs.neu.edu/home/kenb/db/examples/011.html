<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
Exercise 16.7
<p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Isolation Level<th>Reason
<tr><td>Read Committed Read Write<td>A record is inserted into the Enrolled table.  No reading is performed
(except in the index) so dirty reads are not an issue.  The index will
automatically prevent inserting two records with the same primary key, and that is the only phantom that
could be a problem.
The exclusive lock on the inserted record is held until commit.
<tr><td>Read Committed Read Write<td>A record is deleted from the Enrolled table and another is inserted.
The deleted record requires an exclusive lock which is held until commit.  The inserted record will also
have an exclusive lock that is held until commit.  
<tr><td>Serializable Read Write<td>Computing the class with the least number of students would be affected by
phantoms, so one must have phantom protection.  Only the Serializable level will give this.
<tr><td>Read Uncommitted Read Only<td>There are two answers for this question.  If it is required that the
exact number of students in each class be known at a specific time, then one must use the Serializable level
to prevent phantoms.
However, it is unlikely that this would be useful since the number of students in each class is constantly
changing.  Accordingly, it is enough to give an approximate answer, and Read Uncommitted will give it.

Exercise 16.8
<p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>Isolation Level<th>Reason
<tr><td>Read Committed Read Write<td>A record is inserted into the Parts table.  No reading is performed
(except in the index) so dirty reads are not an issue.  The index will
automatically prevent inserting two records with the same primary key, and that is the only phantom that
could be a problem.
The exclusive lock on the inserted record is held until commit.
<tr><td>Read Committed Read Write<td>One record in the Catalog table is updated.  The old value is read
and its value cannot be dirty (uncommitted).  Phantoms are not an issue.
However, if the update is performed by first acquiring a shared lock and then upgrading it to an exclusive lock, then Repeatable Read is necessary.  Since one cannot know exactly
what a database system is going to do, it is safest to use Repeatable Read, but
Read Committed should, in principle, be enough.
<tr><td>Read Uncommitted Read Only<td>There are two answers for this question.  If it is required that the
exact number of items at a specific time be computed, then one must use the Serializable level
to prevent phantoms.
However, it is unlikely that this would be useful since the number of items is constantly
changing.  Accordingly, it is enough to give an approximate answer, and Read Uncommitted will give it.
<tr><td>Serializable Read Only<td>Although this is a read only query, it is very sensitive to phantoms
and dirty reads.  Unlike the total number query, there is no concept of "approximate answer" for this
query.
