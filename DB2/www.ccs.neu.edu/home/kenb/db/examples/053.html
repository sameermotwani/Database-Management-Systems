<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
<p>
Show the optimized query evaluation plans for the following schema and queries.
For each query show the optimal evaluation plans and explain why it is the optimal plan.
Show the evaluation plan as a tree with each internal node annotated with the implementation technique,
and with each edge annotated with a rough estimate of the average number of records that flow
along that edge during evaluation. When there is a "not exists" join, the selectivity
can be estimated using the technique explained in
<a href="058.html">Selectivity of Not Exists Joins</a>.
Since this was not discussed in class, you may use 2% as the selectivity for this
assignment.
