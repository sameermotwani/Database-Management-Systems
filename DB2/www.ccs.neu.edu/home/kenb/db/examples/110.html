<center><h2>Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
Design a database for managing software components.
A component has a unique name and may have authors.
Each component has versions, exactly one of which is current.
Each version has a version number and a release date.
A component version may use other component versions.
Some components are web services.  A web service has
a definition.  Some components are utilities.
A utility has a price and may have a specification.
<p>
Show your design as a UML or ER diagram.  Show all cardinality
constraints on both associations and attributes.
<p>
<img src="images/244.gif" alt="Solution"/>
<p>
Here are some alternative solutions:
<ul>
<li><a href="images/245.gif">A separate class is used for the current versions.</a>
<li><a href="images/246.gif">The Component class is itself regarded as being a version; namely, the current version.</a>
</ul>
Both of these solutions are equivalent to the one shown above.
They have the disadvantage one must allow an instance of the Version
class to change its type. This is impossible for most OO programming
languages. It is possible for databases, but it can be awkward.
<p>
<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
<p>
The grade is based on the design elements that were correctly included:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Component class</li>
<li>Component name attribute of type string</li>
<li>Component name attribute is the primary key</li>
<li>Component authors attribute of type string</li>
<li>Component authors attribute has cardinality [0..*]</li>
<li>Version class</li>
<li>Version id attribute of type int or string</li>
<li>Version id attribute is the primary key</li>
<li>Version number attribute of type string</li>
<li>Version release date attribute of type Date</li>
<li>Version id attribute of type int or string</li>
<li>Utility class</li>
<li>Utility price attribute of type double or int</li>
<li>Utility specification attribute of type string</li>
<li>Utility specification attribute has cardinality [0..1]</li>
<li>Web Service class</li>
<li>Web Service definition attribute</li>
<li>Utility class is subclass of Component class</li>
<li>Web Service class is subclass of Component class</li>
<li>current association joining Component with Version</li>
<li>current association has cardinality 0..1 on Component side</li>
<li>current association has cardinality 1 on Version side</li>
<li>current association has an association class</li>
<li>has association joining Component with Version</li>
<li>has association has cardinality 1 on Component side</li>
<li>has association has cardinality 1..* on Version side</li>
<li>has association has an association class</li>
<li>current association class is subclass of has association class</li>
<li>uses association joining Version with itself</li>
<li>uses association has cardinality 0..* on one Version side</li>
<li>uses association has cardinality 0..* on the other Version side</li>
</ol>
<p>
Translating this data model to SQL gives this schema:
<p>
<pre>
create table Component(
  name varchar(255) primary key
);
create table ComponentAuthors(
  component varchar(255),
  foreign key(component) references Component(name) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  author varchar(255),
  primary key(component, author)
);
create table ComponentVersion(
  id int primary key,
  number varchar(255) not null,
  releaseDate date not null
);
create table Utility(
  name varchar(255) primary key,
  foreign key(name) references Component(name) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  price double not null,
  specification varchar(50000) null
);
create table WebService(
  name varchar(255) primary key,
  foreign key(name) references Component(name) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  definition varchar(50000) not null  
);
create table uses(
  user int,
  foreign key(user) references ComponentVersion(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  usee int,
  foreign key(usee) references ComponentVersion(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(user, usee)
);
create table has(
  component varchar(255),
  foreign key(component) references Component(name) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  version int primary key,
  foreign key(version) references ComponentVersion(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table current(
  component varchar(255) unique,
  foreign key(component) references Component(name) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  version int primary key,
  foreign key(version) references ComponentVersion(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  foreign key(component, version) references has(component, version)
);
