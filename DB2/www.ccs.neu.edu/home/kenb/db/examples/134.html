<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
<h2>A. Stored Procedures</h2>
<p>
Develop a stored procedure that computes the diameter of a graph starting from a specified vertex.
Your procedure should be named <code>diameter</code>. It takes two parameters. The first is an in
parameter that specifies the starting vertex id. The second is an out parameter that returns the
diameter (i.e., the maximum distance from the starting vertex to any other vertex). You will need
a test program. Submit your test program as well as the code that creates the stored procedure.
<p>
<h2>B. Transaction Management and Concurrency</h2>
<p>
For each of the following schedules, determine whether each one is conflict-serializable,
view-serializable and strict. If it is conflict-serializable show the equivalent serial
schedule, and explain why it is equivalent. If it is not conflict-serializable, show why.
If it is view-serializable show the equivalent serial
schedule, and explain why it is equivalent. If it is not view-serializable, show why.
If it is strict, explain why. If it is not strict, explain why not.
