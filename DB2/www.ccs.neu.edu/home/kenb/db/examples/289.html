<center><h3>Extra Identifier in UML Class</h3></center>
<p>
During translation from UML to the relational model, the object identity must be simulated in some way.
The usual way to accomplish this is to introduce a new field to act as the object identity.
Most commonly, this field is named "id" and it has type int.  The reason for using int as the type is
that modern computers are very highly optimized for handling the int type.
<p>
If a UML class has a field has a field named "id", then one cannot use this name for the primary key
when translating from UML to the relational model.  One must use some other name for the primary key.
Here is an example:
<p>
<center> <img src="images/290.jpg"/></center>
<p>
The corresponding relational schema is:
<p>
<pre>
create table Student (
  id2 int primary key,
  id int not null unique,
  name varchar(200) not null,
  phone varchar(200)
);
</pre>
<p>

In general, when translating from UML to the relational model, there will be
issues such as name clashes (as in the case of the extra id field above),
different syntax for names (e.g., UML allows spaces in names, but not all
databases and programming languages allow this).  Consequently, the translation
to the relation model (or to other languages) will involve name changes.
