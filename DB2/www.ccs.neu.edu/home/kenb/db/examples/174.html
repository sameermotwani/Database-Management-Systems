<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
Some of the problems in this assignment will use the
<a href="149.html">Sample Schema</a>. The queries are listed below.  Assume that:
the following are the sizes, counts and times:
<ol>
<li>A record requires an average of 4 bytes administrative overhead,
including the space required for specifying the rid.
<li>An int uses 4 bytes.
<li>A double uses 8 bytes.
<li>A Date uses 8 bytes.
<li>A composition name uses an average of 40 bytes.
<li>A person name uses an average of 30 bytes.
<li>There are 10K compositions.
<li>There are 1K persons.
<li>The disk block size is 8K = 8192 bytes.
<li>A random disk access requires 8ms.
<li>A page can be transferred (read or write) in 0.1 ms = 100 microseconds.
</ol>
<p>
Compute the approximate time required for every query listed below 
for each of the following 4 table structures:
<ol>
<li>Clustered Heap.  An unordered collection of records packed into sequential blocks.
<li>Clustered Sort.  An ordered collection of records packed into sequential blocks.
In each case, order it by the field being queried (e.g., for the first query
assume ordered by composer id).
<li>Clustered B-tree.  The ordering and clustering is by the field being queried.
<li>Unclustered heap with index.  Assume the index is
a B-tree index in which only one level
of the tree is on disk, and the other levels are in main memory.  
Unclustered means the following:
<ol>
<li>The records are randomly located with respect to the query field.
<li>The blocks are randomly located on the disk.
<li>The blocks are only 2/3 full.
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Using the <a href="149.html">Sample Schema</a>,
program a stored procedure for each of the table constraints (CHECK clauses) that does the following:
 <ol>
 <li>Computes the number of violations of the tables constraint; and
 <li>Returns the primary key of one of the violations.
 </ol>
<p>
<li>Find all compositions with a duration greater than 1 hour.
<li>Find the composition names of compositions composed by a composer given the composer's id.
<li>Find the composition names of compositions composed by a composer given the composer's name
<li>Find all persons born on a specified date.
<li>Insert a new composition.
<li>Delete a person (and all of the person's compositions).
</ol>
