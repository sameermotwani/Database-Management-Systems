<center><h1>Role Names in UML</h1></center>
<p>
The role names for the ends of an association have been part of UML class diagrams
for a long time, but common use of this feature is relatively recent. For a long
time associations were labeled with a single name with the direction indicated
by a small arrowhead like this:
<p>

<p>
This notation is still being used. It is also common to omit the arrowhead.
By contrast, the role name notation has a separate name for each of the two directions:
<p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the direction of each role name is now ambiguous. This is made worse
by the fact that there are conflicting definitions of the meaning of the role names
in ISO standards. I checked with my contacts at the OMG, and I have determined that
the current interpretation of the role names is that both the role name and the
cardinality constraint are at the "far end" relative to the subject of the sentence
(and at the "near end" relative to the object of the sentence). The conflicting
standards have now been superseded.
Thus the relationship between Course and Faculty should be read as follows:
<ul>
<li>"Faculty teaches Course" (using the role name "teaches" that is farthest from Faculty) and
<li>"Course is taught by Faculty" (using the role name "isTaughtBy" that is farthest from Course)
</ul>
Similarly, the cardinality constraints are also at the "far end" relative to the
subject of the sentence:
<ul>
<li>"A Faculty teaches any number of Courses" (using the cardinality constraint [0..*] that is farthest from Faculty) and
<li>"A Course is taught by exactly one Faculty" (using the cardinality constraint [1..1] that is farthest from Course)
</ul>
<p>
Incidentally, the cardinality constraints [0..*] and [1..1] are allowed to be abbreviated to simply "*" and "1".
The diagram above would then look like this:
