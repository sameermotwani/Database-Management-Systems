<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
Problems 1, 2, 3 and 6 on the exam use this schema and statistics
for a bakery database:
<p>
<pre>
create table Dessert(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(300),
  description varchar(2000)
);
create table Material(
  name varchar(100) primary key,
  unit varchar(20) not null
);
create table Ingredient(
  dessert int references Dessert(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,
  material varchar(100) references Material(name)
    on delete cascade on update cascade,
  amount double not null,
  primary key(dessert, material)
);
create table Cake(
  id int primary key references Dessert(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  shape varchar(100)
);
create table Cookie(
  id int primary key references Dessert(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  weight double not null
);
</pre>
<p>
<ul>
<li> A record requires an average of 10 bytes administrative overhead,
including the space required for specifying the rid.
<li> An int uses 4 bytes.
<li> A double uses 8 bytes.
<li> A name (in any table) or a shape uses an average of 50 bytes.
<li> A unit uses an average of 10 bytes.
<li> A description uses an average of 500 bytes.
<li> There are 10K desserts, 1K materials, 6K cakes and 6K cookies.
<li> Each dessert uses an average of 20 ingredients.
<li> The disk block size is 8K = 8192 bytes.
<li> A random disk access requires 6ms.
<li> A page can be transferred (read or write) in 0.6 ms = 600 microseconds.
</ul>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>JPA</b>. (10 points) The following method finds all cakes that use at least 5 units of chocolate.  Note that 'chocolate' is the name of a material.
Each table has a corresponding class, and the ingredients of a cake is
specified by an ingredients field in the Cake class which is of type Set.
Fill in the missing statements.
 <pre>
    public Set&lt;Cake> getChocolateCakes(EntityManagerFactory factory) {
        EntityManager em = factory.createEntityManager();
        em.getTransaction().begin();
<font color="green">
        Query q = em.createQuery("select c from Cake c join c.ingredients i where i.material.name='chocolate' and i.amount>=5");
        Set&lt;Cake> cakes = new HashSet&lt;Cake>();
        for (Cake cake : (List&lt;Cake>) q.getResultList()) {
            cakes.add(cake);
        }
</font>
        em.getTransaction().commit();
        em.close();
        return cakes;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria (1 point each):
<ol>
<li>Create a query object: Query q = em.createQuery
<li>The select clause returns a cake object: "select c"
<li>The from clause retrieves from the Cake class: "from Cake c"
<li>Join with ingredients: "join c.ingredients i"
<li>Where clause restricts material: "where i.material.name='chocolate'"
<li>Where clause restricts amount: "where i.amount>=5"
<li>Construct the cakes set: Set&lt;Cake> cakes = new HashSet&lt;Cake>();
<li>For loop on Cake instances
<li>Compute q.getResultList()
<li>cakes.add(cake);
</ol>
<p>
</font>
<li><b>Query performance</b>. (8 points) 
<ol>
<li type="a">Compute the number of blocks required
for the Ingredient table using a clustered heap and
also using a B-tree.
<p>
<font color="green">
An ingredient record requires 10+4+50+8=72 bytes. There are 10K desserts each of which has 20 ingredients on average,
for a total of 200K ingredient records or 72*200K = 14,400K bytes or about 1.8K blocks for the heap and 2.7K blocks for a B-tree.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria (1 point each):
<ol>
<li>Bytes per record is 72.
<li>Total number of bytes is 14,400 KBytes.
<li>1.8K blocks for clustered heap.
<li>2.7K blocks for B-tree
</ol>
</font>
<p>
<li type="a">How long does it take to compute the list of ingredients for 
a dessert specified by an id?  Compute this for both of the following
file structures:
<p>
<ol>
<li type="i">Clustered heap for all tables.
<li type="i">Using the following file structures:
 <ul>
 <li>Dessert table uses a clustered hash table on its primary key and
 a B-tree index on the name column.
 <li>Ingredient table uses a clustered B-tree on its primary key.
 <li>Material table has a clustered B-tree index on its primary key.
 <li>Both Cake and Cookie tables use a clustered hash table on their
 primary keys.
 </ul>
</ol>
<p>
<font color="green">
Only the Ingredient table is used for either file structure. For the
clustered heap one must scan the entire table.  Using the computation
from the first part of the problem this requires 6ms + 1,800 * 0.6ms = 1086ms or about 1 sec.
For the clustered B-tree, one can use the index because the dessert id is the first column.
As only 20 ingredients are retrieved on average, they will nearly always be in the same block.
So it will require 6ms + 6ms = 12ms in all.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria (1 point each):
<ol>
<li>Clustered heap is scanned.
<li>Time for the scan is about 1 second.
<li>B-tree index is used.
<li>Time for use of B-tree index is 12ms.
</ol>
</font>
</ol>
<p>
<li><b>Query Optimization</b>. (14 points) The following query lists
the names and descriptions of all desserts that are both cakes and cookies
and whose name begins with the letter 'Z':
<p>
<pre>
  select d.description
    from Dessert d, Cake c, Cookie k
   where c.id = d.id
     and k.id = d.id
     and d.name like 'Z%';
</pre>
<p>
Show the optimized query plan for this query using the following table
structures. Estimate the size of the data flow (number of records)
along each edge in the query evaluation plan.
 <ul>
 <li>Dessert table uses a clustered hash table on its primary key and
 a B-tree index on the name column.
 <li>Ingredient table uses a clustered B-tree on its primary key.
 <li>Material table has a clustered B-tree index on its primary key.
 <li>Both Cake and Cookie tables use a clustered hash table on their
 primary keys.
 </ul>
<p>
<font color="green">
There are 26 letters in the alphabet so one would expect about 384 desserts to match.
This is much lower than the number of records in the Cookie and Cake tables, but
when record sizes are considered, the Cookie table is somewhat smaller.  This would
suggest that the Cookie table should be the first one.  So I accepted using either
the Dessert table or the Cookie table as the first one.  All of the joins must be
sort-merge joins because the number of records is too large to use the indexes.
The wildcard match could have used the name index, but the number of records is
too large for this to be more efficient.  So here is the query plan:
<ol>
<li>Scan Dessert table and select on 'Z%'.  The input is 10K records, and the output is about 400.
<li>Merge-join with either Cookie or Cake.  The inputs are 400 dessert records and 6K other records. The output is about 200 records.
<li>Merge-join with the last table.  The inputs are 200 on one side and 6K on the other side. The output is about 100 records.
<li>Scan to perform the projection on the description field.  The input and output are both about 100 records.
</ol>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria (1 point each):
<ol>
<li>10K Dessert records
<li>Select on name='Z%'
<li>Use scan for select
<li>400 records are selected
<li>6K Cookie records
<li>First join
<li>Use sort-merge
<li>Output of first join is 200 records
<li>6K Cake records
<li>Second join
<li>Use sort-merge
<li>Output of second join is 100 records
<li>Project
<li>Use scan for project
</ol>

<p>
<li><b>Concurrency</b> (5 points) Consider this schedule:
<p>
R<sub>3</sub>(B)
W<sub>1</sub>(C)
R<sub>2</sub>(B)
W<sub>3</sub>(C)
W<sub>3</sub>(A)
R<sub>1</sub>(B)
W<sub>2</sub>(C)
C<sub>2</sub>
R<sub>1</sub>(A)
C<sub>3</sub>
C<sub>1</sub>
<p>
Determine whether this schedule is view serializable. If it is view
serializable, then give a view equivalent serial schedule. If it is
not view serializable, then explain why not.
<p>
<font color="green">
It is not conflict serializable, so the only way to show
view serializability is to find an equivalent serial schedule.
It is view serializable in the order 3, 1, 2:
<p>
R<sub>3</sub>(B)
W<sub>3</sub>(C)
W<sub>3</sub>(A)
C<sub>3</sub>
W<sub>1</sub>(C)
R<sub>1</sub>(B)
R<sub>1</sub>(A)
C<sub>1</sub>
R<sub>2</sub>(B)
W<sub>2</sub>(C)
C<sub>2</sub>
<p>
This is the only order that is view equivalent.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria:
<ol>
<li>(5 points) It is view serializable and the correct equivalent serial schedule was given.
<li>(3.75 points) It is view serializable but the incorrect schedule 1, 3, 2 was given.
<li>(2.5 points) It is view serializable but the incorrect schedule 2, 3, 1 was given.
<li>(2.5 points) It is view serializable but the incorrect schedule 1, 2, 3 was given.
<li>(2.5 points) It was not view serializable after checking every order or giving a proof.
<li>(1.25 points) It is view serializable and every serial order is equivalent.
<li>(1.25 points) It was not view serializable but no reason was given and no orders were checked.
<li>(1.25 points) It is conflict serializable with schedule 3, 2, 1.
<li>(1.25 points) It is view serializable but no serial schedule was given.
<li>(1.25 points) It is not conflict serializable and from this it was incorrectly inferred that it is not view serializable.
</ol>

<p>
<li><b>Normalization</b>. (16 points) In a university, an employee
has a name and may work for departments. A department has a name.
Each department is part of college. A college has
a unique name. An employee cannot work within more than one college.
Design a database for this university. Show your database design using
a UML diagram, and then translate your UML diagram to SQL. 
<p>
<font color="green">
The UML diagram is
<br><img src="images/187.gif" alt="University Data Model"/></br>
As an alternative, one can model the name attributes using associations
as in this diagram:
<br>
 <img src="images/186.gif" alt="Alternate University Data Model"/>
<br>
The translation of either of these to the relational model is:
<p>
<pre>
create table College(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(200) not null unique
);
create table Employee(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(200) not null
);
create table Department(
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(200) not null,
  college int not null,
  foreign key(college) references College(id) on update cascade on delete cascade
);
create table Employment(
  employee int,
  foreign key(employee) references Employee(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  department int,
  foreign key(department) references Department(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  primary key(employee, department)
);
create view WorksWithin(employee, college) as
  select distinct e.employee, d.college
    from Employment e, Department d
   where e.department = d.id;
</pre>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria (0.5 points each, except as noted):
<ul>
<li>UML Diagram (8 points)
<ol>
<li>Employee class
<li>Employee name attribute
<li>College class
<li>College name attribute
<li>College name attribute is unique
<li>Department class
<li>Department name attribute
<li>Aggregation of Department by College
<li>Aggregation has multiplicity 1 on College side
<li>Aggregation has multiplicity 0..* on Department side
<li>Association between Employee and Department
<li>Association has multiplicity 0..* on Employee side
<li>Association has multiplicity 0..* on Department side
<li>Derived association between Employee and College
<li>Derived association has multiplicity 0..* on Employee side
<li>Derived association has multiplicity 0..1 on College side
</ol>
<li>Relational Schema (8 points)
<ol>
<li>(0.375 points) College table has a primary key
<li>(0.375 points) College name attribute is not null
<li>(0.375 points) College name attribute is unique
<li>(0.375 points) Employee table has a primary key
<li>(0.375 points) Employee name attribute is not null
<li>(0.375 points) Department table has a primary key
<li>(0.375 points) Department name attribute is not null
<li>(0.375 points) Department college attribute is not null
<li>(0.375 points) Department college attribute references College(id)
<li>(0.375 points) Employment employee attribute references Employee(id)
<li>(0.375 points) Employment employee attribute references Department(id)
<li>(0.375 points) WorksWithin view
<li>(1 point) WorksWithin view has a constraint
<li>WorksWithin query has select distinct
<li>WorksWithin query has select e.employee, d.college
<li>WorksWithin query has from Employment
<li>WorksWithin query has from Department
<li>WorksWithin query has join condition
</ol>
</ul>
</font>
<p>
<font color="red">
The view unique constraint would have to be enforced by a mechanism such as a trigger.
In such a trigger the view would be computed and the constraint would be checked.
Simply saying that one would use a trigger and then restating the problem to be solved
is not an acceptable answer.  One must show the SQL query that the trigger would evaluate
and the SQL constraint it would check.
</font>
<p>
<li><b>Security</b>. (7 points) Allow the user named 'Alice'
to update the ingredients used by cakes (including whether an
ingredient is used and what amount is used).
<p>
<font color="green">
There are two parts to this problem.  A view must be developed and
a grant command executed:
<pre>
create view CakeView as
  select i.*
    from Ingredient i, Cake c
   where i.dessert = c.id;

grant insert, update, delete on CakeView to 'Alice';
</pre>
<p>
Giving select privileges on various tables would be appropriate in practice,
but no points were deducted if this was not done.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Scoring criteria (1 point each):
<ol>
<li>View selects the ingredient columns
<li>View query is from Ingredient table
<li>View query is from Cake table
<li>View query has the correct join condition
<li>Grant command must include insert, update and delete
<li>Grant command uses the view
<li>Grant privileges to 'Alice'
</ol>
