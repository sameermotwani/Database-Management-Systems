<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
A database for a library has the following two tables:
<pre>
Book(isbn char(11), date Date, author int, publisher string, primary key(isbn))
Person(id int, name string, date Date, primary key(int))
</pre>
<p>
The publication date of a book is the year of publication.
The date of a person is the date of birth.
<p>
The following are the sizes, counts and times:
<ol>
<li>A record requires an average of 6 bytes administrative overhead.
<li>A rid uses 4 bytes.
<li>An int uses 4 bytes.
<li>A Date uses 8 bytes.
<li>Names (publisher or author) use an average of 32 bytes.
<li>Person names are nearly unique.
<li>There are 6M books.
<li>There are 4M persons.
<li>There are 6K publishers.
<li>The disk block size is 4K = 4096 bytes.
<li>A random disk access requires 10ms.
<li>A page can be transferred (read or write) in 0.1 ms = 100 microseconds.
</ol>
<p>
Consider the following queries (or operations):
<ol>
<li>Find a person id, given the person's name.
<li>Find all books published by a publisher.
<li>Insert a book in the database.  Assume that the author is already
in the database, but it is necessary to look up the author's id (as in the
first query).
</ol>
<p>
Perform the following computations:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Compute the average amount of space required for the records of each table.
<li>Compute the average number of records of each table that can fit in one disk block.
<li>Compute the number of blocks required for each table in two cases:
 <ol>
 <li>The blocks are full.
 <li>The blocks are only 2/3 full on average.
 </ol>
<li>Compute the approximate time required for the two queries and one operation 
for each of the following 3 table structures:
<ol>
<li>Heap.  An unordered collection of records packed into sequential blocks.
<li>Clustered Sort.  An ordered collection of records packed into sequential blocks.
In each case, order it by the field being queried (e.g., for the first query
assume ordered by person name).
<li>Clustered B-tree.  The ordering and clustering is by the field being queried.
</ol>
