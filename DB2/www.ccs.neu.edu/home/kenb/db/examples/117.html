<center><h2>Solution to Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
 Find all band names of bands that do not have a musician that plays 
both a string instrument and a percussion instrument.
<pre>
select b.name
  from Band b
 where not exists(
         select *
           from plays p, StringInstrument si, PercussionInstrument pi, memberOf m
          where b.id = m.band
            and p.person = m.person
            and p.instrument = si.id
            and p.instrument = pi.id
       );
</pre>

<p>
Note that Band must be the first table in the evaluation plan.
These joins are outer joins, and the result of the last outer join
is restricted (by the selection) to the bands that do not have a
match with the other tables.
