<center><h1>Sample Exercise</h1></center>
<p>
Vehicles may be parked in a garage.  Every garage has an address.
Some vehicles are cars, and some are boats.
Every vehicle has a unique vin (vehicle identification number)
and a power rating (in horsepower).  A vehicle has at least one owner
(known only by name) but may have several.  A car has a number of tires.
A boat has a number of propellers and may have a name.
<p>
Here is the design:
<p>
<img src="images/250.jpg" alt="Data Model"/>
<p>
<pre>
create table Garage(
  id int primary key,
  address varchar(255) not null
);
create table Vehicle(
  id int primary key.
  vin int not null unique,
  power double not null,
  parkedIn int references Garage(id) /* Optional many to one association. */
    on update cascade on delete set null
);
create table Car( /* Subclass of Vehicle */
  id int primary key references Vehicle(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  numberOfTires int not null
);
create table Boat(
  id int primary key references Vehicle(id) /* Subclass of Vehicle */
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  numberOfPropellers int not null,
  name varchar(255) /* Optional boat name */
);
create table VehicleOwner( /* Multi-valued attribute owners of Vehicle */
  vehicle int references Vehicle(id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
  owner varchar(255),
  primary key(vehicle, owner)
);
-- The following is not required:
alter table Vehicle
  add foreign key(id) references VehicleOwner(vehicle) on update cascade on delete no action;
