<center><h2>Sample Exercise</h2></center>
<p>
<ol>
<li>(12 points) A geographer has a database of cities that are located on rivers (and only cities like this).
A city can be located on several rivers, and a river may meet some cities.
Each city has a name, possibly several. A river has a unique name and a length.
A river can be the tributary of another river.
Design a UML class diagram for the database described above.
<p>
<li>(17 points)
Here is a data model written in UML:
<p>

<p>
Translate this data model to SQL.
<p>
<li>Here is an SQL schema for tracking the time spent by miners in various mines:
<pre>
create table Person (
  id int primary key,
  name varchar(100)
);
create table Mine (
  designation varchar(100) primary key,
  location varchar(5000) not null
);
create table WorkInterval (
  miner int references Person(id)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  mine varchar(100) not null references Mine(designation)
    on update cascade on delete cascade,
  start datetime not null,
  end datetime,
  primary key(miner, start),
  check (end is null or end > start)
);
</pre>
Write the following queries in SQL:
<p>
A. (8 points) For each miner, list the miner's name and the date when the miner first started working in some mine.
<p>
B. (8 points) List the mines by location that have a person named Luis who has worked in the mine.
<p>
<li>(15 points) Using the schema in the previous problem,
the following method prints the miners who are currently in a specified mine and how long each has been in the mine (in hours):
 <pre>
public void printWorkingMiners(Connection connection, String mine) throws SQLException {
    long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date now = new Date(currentTime);
    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement
        ("select p.name, p.id, w.start from Person p, WorkInterval w " +
         "where w.miner=p.id and w.mine=? and w.start&lt;? and w.end is null");

    /* Fill in the missing statements here. */

        double durationInHours = (currentTime - start.getTime()) / (1000.0 * 3600.0);
        System.out.println(name + " (" + id + ") has been in the mine for " + durationInHours + " hours.");
    }
    statement.close();
}
</pre>
Fill in the missing statements.
</ol>
